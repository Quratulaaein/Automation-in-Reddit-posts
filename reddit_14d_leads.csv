1odxkk6,2025-10-23T08:12:03,startups,Best dev path / platform for app MVP? (I will not promote),"We’ve decided to build an app we think might complement our business and we want to launch a very basic version to validate the demand / our current customers response to it. It’s crucial for us to have in-app purchases and push notifications as we’d like to validate upselling our current products through the app. Our goal is around 500-1000 users and proving profitability on paid campaigns. Our options are: 1. Get an outsource developer, which I estimate would cost around $3k-$8k for what we want (still very early planning and research phase - this is based on offers I got on Upwork with a vague description). 2. Develop it ourselves with our current web devs through capacitorjs.com (or any other framework that allows using HTML/JS to build a native app). Then if it shows promise, move forward by outsourcing or hiring in-house app devs. 3. Use a prompt-to-app/ no-code platform like Base44/lovable/natively or Wix (which surprised me with a platform that’s seems pretty cool). === The advantage of #3 will be our content team could just set up the content with no development time and costs at all and no technical background - which is why our CEO is attracted to this option. . #1 is within budget for the project, but I’m worried about picking the wrong dev, getting stuck, or being dependent on that dev for every tiny change - and we’ll have a lot while optimizing and split testing until we’re profitable. I’m pushing for option #2, as it give us control, fast to develop with our devs we trust (and it’s cheaper since they are already on the team), and I’m worried that with option #3 we will lose our users when we’re ready to move form MVP to a “real” app as we will need to move to our own apple developer account and/or have a new app rather than changing the code of the existing one. Am I understanding this correctly? Is there anything else I should be taking into account in order to make this decision?",7,,500-1000,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1odxkk6/best_dev_path_platform_for_app_mvp_i_will_not/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1ok9iiu,2025-10-30T19:40:09,DesignJobs,[Hiring] Document Design in Word,"Budget $1000 Hi! I'm looking for a document designer. I sell highly specialized planners with an existing customer base, and am looking to get a redesign for the new year. This is not a full brand refresh. Fonts, color palette, logo and core planner components and data won't change. What I need is: * Conversion to full-bleed for a printed version * General aesthetic beautification of cover, monthly page, weekly page, highlights, calendar, etc. I'm open to negotiating the scope of the work. The good news: I used to be a tech writer and info architect and have consulted, so I get the work (I just don't have an eye for design and am WAY too close to this to be objective). The planners all exist in current fixed form, so not a ton of back and forth on content. I'm currently a project manager so my shit is together. The cons: The planners are data driven out of a giant Excel spreadsheet. That means they are in table form and need to remain table form. That also means... Word (sorry!) and not PhotoShop, Illustrator, etc. That's why I consider this document design and not graphic design. Finally, you'll need to be comfortable with the nature of my planners, which are astrological, witchy, and magical. Bonus if you have access to the Physis astrological font, which is the only paid font I use.

1oie5vd,2025-10-28T16:31:39,india,"How Sridhar Vembu, ""Chief Scientist at Zoho"", is Putting Indian Children at Risk with Debunked Vaccine Myths","### Background The fear-mongering started with this tweet: https://x.com/NicHulscher/status/1982895909668302992 The author claims that they have done a meta-analysis of over 300 studies to conclude that vaccinations are the dominant risk factor for Autism. --- **Remember, [vaccines do not cause autism](https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-safe-and-effect-no-link-to-autism)** --- ### The ""Study"" The story lists **Andrew Wakefield** and **Peter A. McCullough** as co-authors, and both had their medical licenses revoked for unethical practices and promoting conspiracy theories about vaccines. **Andrew Wakefield is the author of the infamous and 1998 paper (that was later retracted) that proposed a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.** His license was later revoked, and he has since dedicated his life to peddling conspiracy theories about vaccines. **Why was Wakefield's study fraudulent?** [An investigation by Sunday Times reporter Brian Deer](https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347) revealed undisclosed financial conflicts of interest - Wakefield reportedly stood to earn up to $43 million per year selling test kits. The General Medical Council also found that he had not disclosed funding from lawyers suing vaccine manufacturers. The publicity surrounding his study caused a sharp decline in vaccination uptake, leading to outbreaks of measles around the world and many preventable deaths. **Recommended reading: [One paper, 20 years of damage](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/medicine-access/one-paper-twenty-years-of-damage/89422527)** **Peter A. McCullough is a former cardiologist [who had his license revoked](https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/features/113624) after he continuously peddled misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine.** While he still technically holds medical licenses in Texas and Michigan, the loss of board certification significantly impacts his ability to practice in hospitals and with insurance networks. --- ### The Evidence Against the Vaccine-Autism Link is Overwhelming Since Wakefield's fraudulent study, approximately 20 other studies have been conducted by different researchers, in different populations, and in different countries - and every single one has found no association between vaccines and autism. [A comprehensive 2014 meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/) included five cohort studies involving 1,256,407 children and five case-control studies involving 9,920 children. The conclusion? Vaccinations are not associated with the development of autism or autism spectrum disorder, and vaccine components (thimerosal or mercury) or multiple vaccines (MMR) are not associated with autism development. -- ### Vembu's Scientific Opinions Sridhar Vembu jumped onto this bandwagon with this tweet. >[Parents should take this analysis seriously. **I believe there is increasing evidence that we are giving way too many vaccines to very young children.** This is spreading in Indi...",7,,1982997965234155949;1982895909668302992;24814559;89422527,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1oie5vd/how_sridhar_vembu_chief_scientist_at_zoho_is/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1oh78ua,2025-10-27T06:29:04,india,Some advice for those looking out to building a career in law,"If you are building a career in law, you need to know this. The legal sector is growing, the pay is excellent and that is a fact. But at the same time it is not growing at the rate we are producing lawyers, 2 lakh lawyers every year. The top tier firms about whom you read in the papers have maybe 1,000 vacancies, and most graduates struggle for years with low pay and minimal prospects. But the usual explanation is just oversupply, too many lawyers chasing too few jobs. That is but only part of the bigger reason, the real problem is structural. Indian legal education is designed in a way that almost guarantees most graduates won't be practice ready. It's not about talent or hard work, it's about how the system itself is built, and it is built in a manner that people from 2nd generation or more get massive advantage. There is even published research on Indian legal education and the research argues that our system suffers from what they call inverse regulation. The Bar Council of India and UGC are obsessively prescriptive about inputs. Which courses you must take, how many credit hours each needs, what specific topics must be covered, library specifications, faculty ratios, even assessment methods, micromanaged to death. But there's zero clarity on outcomes. No articulation of what a law graduate should actually be capable of doing. No definition of what skills or values they need. Just detailed rules about the process with no vision of the goal. Compare this to the American system where the Bar Association defines clear outcomes (graduates must be ready for effective, ethical, responsible practice) but gives schools flexibility in how to achieve that. Clear goal, flexible pathways is the American approach and India does the exact opposite with hyper detailed pathways, zero clarity on goals. Why does this matter practically? Because it creates what the study calls a theatrical education system. One such example is clinical education which is mandatory in India, every law school must offer it, but this study found that it's essentially fake. There's no provision in BCI rules for supervisory attorneys to guide students in actual cases, so clinical education is just simulations and moot courts. Students pretend to be lawyers rather than learning under supervision in real matters. Or consider the complete separation between legal practice and legal academia. BCI rules prohibit salaried employees from practicing law. Sounds reasonable until you realize the consequence. Law professors can't practice and practicing lawyers who want to teach full time must give up practice. This results in what researchers call a China Wall between academia and profession, and the industry academia gap increases and student lose the benefit of having an education which helps them apply their education to real world scenario. In the US apparently there's constant movement between practice and teaching.

I’ve started creating content multiple times and on multiple channels, but I can never seem to decide which channel to stick to or what kind of content to create. Very recently, I realized this is because I don’t have a clear content strategy. So, I started building one for my products, but it was hard. I couldn’t find great resources, tutorials, videos, or courses online. I really struggled to create a good content strategy. I eventually managed to create one and now have some idea of what kind of content to create, which channels, what hooks, etc. But I still don’t know if my strategy is right or not, because the lead time to see whether the content is working is quite long.

I've spent months developing a business idea I'm really passionate about: simple, cute, high-quality phone cases targeting young women interested in Korean-style trends.

I'm afraid of spending money on competitor products for review, or that no one will see my content.

That sinking feeling in your gut. The one that whispers (sometimes screams, honestly) ""Will this one finally work?"" And here's the thing: over **70% of content creators report feeling completely overwhelmed** by the pressure to produce content that actually makes money, not just... you know, pretty likes and heart emojis from people who'll never buy anything. We're living in what they call the golden age of content, right? Except—and this is the cruel part—most of us are trapped in this endless hamster wheel of production with basically zero conversion. The gap between how hard we work and what we actually earn? It's never felt wider, and somewhere in that painful space between effort and income sits a truth we're all kind of avoiding: what we're doing doesn't work. Hoping harder definitely won't fix it. The content world has become this weird paradox. There's MORE content than ever—like, an estimated 7.5 million blog posts going live every single day (wrap your head around that number)—yet real connection, actual sales... those remain frustratingly out of reach for most creators. You've seen it. Accounts with tens of thousands of followers who can't make a single sale, brilliant insights getting buried under cat videos and dancing influencers, creators burning themselves out while their bank accounts stay depressingly flat. And the advice? Oh, the advice makes me want to scream sometimes. ""Just be authentic!"" they say. ""Post consistently!"" ""Engage with your audience!"" As if the problem is that we're not trying hard enough—when really, the issue runs so much deeper than effort. We're basically operating without any blueprint, creating in complete darkness, hoping our passion will magically transform into profit. Spoiler alert: it doesn't work that way. But what if... and stay with me here... what if your struggle isn't about your talent at all? What if it's just evidence that nobody ever showed you the actual mechanics of persuasion—that invisible architecture separating content that entertains from content that SELLS? Research in behavioral psychology (the nerdy stuff) reveals that purchasing decisions happen in the limbic system, which is your emotional brain, yet most of us are out here appealing to logic. And then wondering why our perfectly crafted arguments fall completely flat. The disconnect is massive. **Creating content that sells—and I mean really sells, not just gets engagement—isn't about being manipulative or using sleazy tactics.** It's understanding this delicate dance between desire and decision, between capturing attention and driving action. Think of it like... okay, every time someone scrolls through social media, they're making hundreds of tiny decisions. Your content? It has maybe 1.7 seconds to interrupt that pattern. To create enough of a disruption that their brain actually pauses and goes, ""Wait. This is different."" That pause—that split-second hes...",5,,,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ojaawp/the_psychology_behind_content_that_actually/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

When you share the preview with me, please include some placeholders for the stats, but the final deliverable will have blank spaces for me to be able to insert the real user's stats into the image. * [Here](https://quantifiedrowing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017-10-31-08-09-34.jpg?w=1640&h=624&crop=1) is an example rowing machine results screen, which the user scans into the app. The sharable image should allow them to share this data - either the high level summary (row 1), or all of the rows.

1oi5ek1,2025-10-28T10:10:06,UXDesign,[UX Feedback] Is This UX Intuitive or Too Much? — Gamified WITZ Quiz App,"Hey r/UXDesign! I’m part of the team behind **WITZ**, a trivia quiz game designed to make general knowledge fun, social, and super engaging — especially for Gen Z users. We’ve just revamped our UX/UI and I’d love your input on a few key screens. Below are screenshots from the current build.About the app: * **Platform**: iOS & Android * **Audience**: 13–25 y/o * **Style**: Playful, gamified, colorful * **Features**: Real-time multiplayer quizzes, custom avatars, daily Battle Royale, themed quiz packs (e.g., Harry Potter), clans, and power-ups. What I’m looking for feedback on:1. Homepage / Navigation Flow * Do you find the tab bar icons intuitive? Is it clear that the joystick icon leads to the main game modes? * Is the central button (“PLAY”) too dominant or just right for a mobile game? * How’s the visual hierarchy? Are your eyes drawn where they should be? 2. Searching for players * Each user is in a team (e.g., Frozen Pizza vs Punk Duck) — does this identity system help or distract from core functionality? * Match countdown timer: Too subtle or well placed? 3. Quiz UI / Gameplay * We’re using a **4-option layout** with power-ups visible at the bottom. Are the **options too small** or just right? * The **progress indicators (top)** show question count, players left, etc. — too busy or helpful? * Do you prefer **bottom-aligned answer buttons** or a different placement? I’d love to hear your **first impressions**, **UX critiques**, or even **small tweaks** you’d suggest. Tear it apart — we’re listening! **Check out the app here if you’re curious:** [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/witz-quiz-duello-trivia/id6450697650](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/witz-quiz-duello-trivia/id6450697650) Thanks in advance! — Gianluca from WITZ",5,,6450697650,https://reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1oi5ek1/ux_feedback_is_this_ux_intuitive_or_too_much/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1ogsbr3,2025-10-26T18:40:11,UXDesign,Is the grass actually greener on the other (product) side? (from a marketer),"Before everyone jumps in to list all the pain points of product design, I just want to say I'm already aware of the common challenges. Like any business role, there's politics, leadership buy-in, and communication issues. I've spent over 10 years in marketing and sales, and I’ve seen just as much of that toxicity there -- the main difference being that marketing teams are usually the first to go in a downturn, while product teams tend to be more stable. My background spans advertising design, campaign management, reporting, marketing analytics, and automation. I’ve actually been thinking about transitioning into product for about three years now, ever since I was laid off in a previous role. Right now, I work at an agency that doesn’t have a product team, so a lateral move isn't possible. At my previous company, it also wasn’t easy since I didn’t have much direct product experience. That said, I did collaborate closely with product designers and engineers on things like product launches, email marketing, and landing page optimization - though my exposure to product work was somewhat limited since it was a small fintech company. I’d love to hear your thoughts on product vs. marketing — specifically whether it’s worth making the switch to product or product design. I’m mainly looking for more stability, the ability to make a bigger impact (it’s nearly impossible to market a bad product), and to have more influence over what’s actually being built.",5,,,https://reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1ogsbr3/is_the_grass_actually_greener_on_the_other/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

ChatGPT, perplexity and bunch of others have rolled out their own browsers with AI chat panels at the side of the screen. that means that websites will be displayed with a narrower aspect ratio on desktops. In the surface it seems a simple change in the available real estate, but in reality there are multiple dimensions to it, layout, semantics, navigation, form inputs.. etc. but sticking to the point, I have started heavily using all the common browsers and test how designs look on them. Thats Why I created this simple Figma doc with the common browser sizes and adjusted the grid spacing to be as close as possible to the actual setup, and have been using it to test layout configurations. Now im more focused on the development side to be honest, so wanted to share the public file and hear your opinions or improvement ideas.

1ojryie,2025-10-30T06:00:33,india,RailOne app refund scam. My experience,"I want to share my experience with the RailOne app so others are aware before using it for train bookings. I booked and later cancelled a train ticket through the RailOne app on 24th October 2025. IRCTC confirmed that the refund was successfully processed with the reference number 100307327549. However, even after several days, I haven’t received the refund in my bank account. I contacted IRCTC, and they confirmed that the refund was already sent to RailOne’s payment gateway. Rail Madad also closed my ticket saying I should contact RailOne directly. I emailed RailOne multiple times but received no response at all. My bank has also confirmed that no refund has been received. It’s clear that IRCTC and RailOne keep passing responsibility between each other while the customer is left helpless. To escalate the matter, I’ve filed a consumer complaint on consumerhelpline.gov.in for “Refund not received.” Please be careful while booking tickets through RailOne. This app is not owned or managed by the government , it’s a private company that uses IRCTC’s API, and when issues occur, there’s no proper support or accountability. Stick to the official IRCTC app or website for your bookings. Sharing this so others don’t go through the same issue.",5,,100307327549,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ojryie/railone_app_refund_scam_my_experience/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1ohnkyq,2025-10-27T19:13:49,india,Pension scam alert for retired railway employees (esp. Central Railway retirees),"My dad recently retired from Central Railways and is still waiting for his first pension. Today he got a call from +91 6291465267 — the guy claimed he was a railway official calling about his pension account. Turns out this is a scam, and it’s honestly quite convincing. The caller seemed to be operating from Kolkata, but somehow had details of employees retired from the Mumbai division, including employee IDs which seems data is being leaked. He spoke confidently, like someone who actually works in the office with correct info including date of birth, designation, employee id number, so it’s easy for retirees to trust him. He then asked my dad to share his screen and log in to his net banking so he could “download the pension slip for verification.” That’s the trap — once you do that, they can see everything and wipe your account. Please warn your parents or anyone retired from railways. These guys are targeting senior citizens who aren’t very tech-savvy. A few quick points: • Don’t screen share or open anybanking app if someone calls saying they’re from the pension office. • No real railway or pension officer will ever ask you to do that. Let’s keep our elders safe — this scam feels well-prepared and could easily fool someone trusting",5,,+91 6291465267,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ohnkyq/pension_scam_alert_for_retired_railway_employees/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1ok20hh,2025-10-30T14:59:12,startups,Developing a Medtech-dental tool ( I will not promote),"Hi Redditors, I have co-founded and prototyped a tool which can be used for orthodontic treatments. Our product has shown a brilliant result at the initial stage; we need to redesign it from the prototype to hit the market. We plan to start with the UK and India, and slowly spread to the rest of the world. The challenges we faced/are facing so far are: 1. Very few clinical validations. Many of the dentists refused to share their thoughts on this idea. Others gave a good response. 2. Cheap products: While our product is innovative in the way it works compared to others, the current market is flooded with cheap products from China. Additionally, they can copy ours until we do some clinical trials and IP our results. Currently, it is outside our budget. 3. We have decided to sell it on online sites, to see the public sentiment. Then, slowly adjust with the customer feedback and develop the product. It can again trigger the counterparts and bring in a cheap version of it with less compliance. 4. Funding: Neither my co-founder nor I has a business background, but we are studying a lot lately. How difficult will it be to find funding? We were initially looking for Government funding, but realised it would take longer than usual, so going towards the investors . I'm sure a lot of you have been in this stage, and believe it is better to seek advice rather than failing the same way others did. Additionally, can you all please help to address the challenges if you were in my place? Also, please do shoot your suggestions and advice, as MedTech can be a bit tricky in terms of operating. Thank you all.",4,,,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ok20hh/developing_a_medtechdental_tool_i_will_not_promote/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1oacwyb,2025-10-19T01:16:18,startups,Solo founder with $100 - how do I actually get my first users? [I will NOT promote],"Okay so I'm a recent graduate and I just launched my first app. It's an Android app that helps students deal with phone addiction through quiz challenges, basically you earn screen time by answering questions and finishing daily goals and stuff . It is a free app with minimal ads. Here's my situation. I have $100. That's it. That's my entire marketing budget. I've been trying to get users for the past couple weeks and it's been EXTREMELY rough. I feel like I will go bald at this rate :') . I literally have $100 wondering if I should just spend it to speed things up or if I'm gonna waste it. I'm targeting students in countries where Android is huge - Turkey, India, Philippines. I even added Turkish language support because Turkey has like 85% Android users and millions of students. Seems like a good market. But I still can't get any traction. Prodcut hunt is so bad cause I had and have no social media presence as a person and as a brand so I am even more lost right now. What would you do? AI says that I just pay nano-influencers like $10-20 each to actually post about it? That's like 5-10 people. They might actually do it if I pay them according to AI but I do not know if it is actually real. Do you guys think that is is even worth it? Or should I try running ads on TikTok or Instagram? I've never run ads before so I'll probably mess it up and waste the money. But everyone says you need to learn paid acquisition eventually right? The thing is, most advice I see online assumes you have like $1K-5K to test different marketing channels. I don't have that and I am down to my last 100 bucks. Assuming that I do not have a job at the moment (THE JOB MARKET SUCKSSSSSSS, I have been searching for months while building this) and this is my last 100 bucks that I can spend on the app and then I have to get back to finding jobs to survive. What do you guys suggest that might actually work when you have basically nothing. So what would you do? Have any of you been in this spot before? Is there some obvious thing I'm missing or should I just keep doing what I'm doing for free? I'm not trying to get rich or anything, I just want to see if this idea actually has legs before I spend months on it. Any advice would be really helpful. And also I AM TIREDDDDDD of this startup situation in general. I never knew working in a startup or building something from scratch is this tiring, Kudos to y'all! and I really admire all of you that are here who built stuff, support startups with tonnes of work and help.

He’s considering: Trying again for NEET-PG next year Exploring non-clinical teaching positions or private medical colleges Shifting abroad (maybe Gulf countries, UK academic route, or online education/edtech) Or even career change into health tech, research, or allied fields If anyone here has been through a similar path or has seen senior physiology faculty move into other viable roles — especially abroad or in private universities — any guidance would mean a lot.

1ok4eda,2025-10-30T16:28:40,Entrepreneur,AI-built consumer apps are what e-commerce/dropshipping was in 2015- and it's just getting started,"In 2015, it was e-commerce. People were spinning up Shopify stores overnight, testing 20 products, scaling the one that went viral. Or to keep it even simpler - list on Amazon a bunch of products you procure from China and then dropship them. Now, the same thing is happening again- except instead of importing gadgets from China, ppl are shipping mobile apps built by AI. And the diff now is that it's 2025 - it's a few years of life with TT, Reels and it has only been slightly less than 2 years + when AI rewrote the rules of building apps. The formula now is simple - vibe code with different AI tools like Lovable, hook it up with Supabase, and then probably refine it with Cursor if you're a dev and wanna focus more on production grade quality code. But in conjunction, you either build in public or hire nanoinfluencers to promote it becuz they are just so great for driving brand awareness and even converting them or you do cold sales of course. Ideally, if you're a founder, you hope to focus on build, growth, strategy and scaling the biz. Well sounds great and all except that before you get there, you have to wear so many different hats and figure out sales, marketing etc which you have absolutely no clue about (unless maybe your cofounder has exp in that too) : *how to pitch to different potential clients, which nanoinfluencers to hire, how to negotiate with them etc* It still isn't easy but it got easier with AI: On the cold sales side, we have experimented with tools like SmartLead to monitor how our cold reach with emails are doing. We do A/B testing with different titles and different content body and figure out what works and what doesn't cuz sometimes it ain't your solution, it's your hook. And we do that effortlessly - at scale with tools like these which is great. We are also trying out Apollo to enrich some data to get the leads to even send the mails out too. Not 100% great but still not too bad as a solution. And on the marketing side, we are trying out tools like ParseBear and Aspire to help automate the discovery and outreach of nanoinfluencers at scale since you get to specify the kind of creators you're looking for as per your campaign. It's also great becuz you get to set your budget etc and get the AI to negotiate with these nanoinfluencers when you know jackshit about the rates and this space but of course with human intervention for when you need that human touch. Why all these tools? Becuz honestly, when you're a founder trying to make your biz work, using whatever tools that work and saves you time and energy to focus on what matters most for you as a founder, it's worth it. Absolutely. What do you guys think?? What other tools are you using to grow your biz?",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ok4eda/aibuilt_consumer_apps_are_what/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

It’s a marketplace concept aimed at helping people earn passive income from something they already own. I’m currently running Facebook ads with a budget of about $9 per day. After a week, the results look like this: - CTR: about 4.0% - CPC: around $0.20 - Leads: 5 people signed up for the waitlist out of ~400 link clicks - Cost per lead: roughly $20 I think the landing page is clear, transparent, and professional (I’ve optimized it a few times), but the conversion rate still feels low considering the click-through rate is solid. I haven’t switched my campaign goal from “traffic” to “leads” yet because I wanted to collect more data first. My plan is to validate demand in one city before expanding. I haven’t really defined my target audience a yet either. Only that I want to show the ad to people between the ages of 35-65+. If you were in my position, what would you do next? - Would you adjust the ad targeting first? - Would you switch to a lead-optimized campaign right away? - Or would you keep testing messaging and landing page variations until conversions improve?

1oivylm,2025-10-29T05:06:33,Entrepreneur,Why Building a Website “Cheap” Often Becomes the Most Expensive Mistake?!,"A few months ago, I saw many small business owners trying to get their first websites up and running. Many were drawn to the lowest price possible, and at first glance, it made sense to me. A simple site, minimal budget, quick delivery. But a few months later, most came back frustrated, asking for help fixing or rebuilding what they already paid for. Here are some patterns I noticed over time: 1. Performance and security issues - Websites built on outdated templates or overloaded with unnecessary plugins often become slow. Basic things like caching, mobile responsiveness or SSL are often ignored to save time and cost and deliver faster 2. Poor SEO and visibility - Many ""budget"" sites lack even the simplest SEO setup, like clean URLs, metadata and sitemap generation. Obviously, the developer is not paid enough to be doing all this on their own. 3. Lack of scalability - When these businesses grow, they realise their sites can't handle new features. Rebuilding from scratch ends up costing more than doing it properly from the start. 4. No support or documentation - Once the site is handed over, the developer disappears. Many of my past clients came to me with their broken sites and no contact with their old developers. As for me, I'm still in touch with my first client from 4 years ago. 5. Poor User Experience - Design and structure are often overlooked. A website can look fine but still fail to guide users effectively toward conversions or key actions. WHAT DID I LEARNED FROM ALL THIS? Cheap solutions often seem like a shortcut, but they usually cost more in the long run, not just financially, but in lost trust, time, and credibility. The better approach is to think of a website as an investment. Even if it costs more initially, the long-term ROI is significantly higher. I’m curious to know if other entrepreneurs here have faced similar issues either while getting a website built or offering web-related services. How did you handle it, and what did you learn from the process?",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1oivylm/why_building_a_website_cheap_often_becomes_the/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

It’s easy to get caught up in templates, trends, and what everyone else is doing online. But real creativity — the kind that actually makes a brand memorable — often comes from constraint and storytelling. I’m curious how other small business owners approach this: * Do you handle your branding and design in-house or outsource it? * How do you keep things creative without overcomplicating or overspending? * Any tools, habits, or frameworks that helped you find your brand’s “voice” visually or emotionally?

1okdg7d,2025-10-30T22:17:37,smallbusiness,Retail Space Lease Guidance,"I’m in the midst of spinning up a company, and I’m having a heck of a time landing a commercial lease. When I first started pursuing the business, I got in touch with two spots, had a quick back and forth, and both expressed interest. I then ran into some vendor issues that delayed the business launch and by the time I was ready, both spots had been leased. I figured that since my hit rate was 100% before, it would be pretty easy to get it going again, but that hasn’t been the case. Since ironing out the vendor issues, all the conversations with commercial realtors have gone something like this... * **Them:** We think this concept is risky. * **Me:** Yes, it’s unproven in America. Two years of operations without profit are expected and I have budgeted for that. * **Them:** Well, we don’t want you to burn your entire life savings. * **Me:** I’m fortunate enough that this only represents a small portion of my life savings. I’m happy to prepay 2–3 years worth of lease up front. * **Them:** Uhm… well… this concept doesn’t really align with the brand vision we have for the space. I'm not in a huge rush to get it going, I want to find the right spot, but this week I got a bit pushed me over the top. I had a conversation with a commercial realtor representing a shopping center that is \~3 years old. They have \~50% vacancy, none of the currently vacant spaces have been leased before. Of the \~50% that are leased, about half are open 3-4 days a week. One place in particular, a cafe, is open just 18 hours a week, and is completely shut down about 1 week out of every 8. I'm having a hard time reconciling a commercial realtor letting a company that is open 60 hours/month on average sign a $4500/month lease, but not willing to work with a well funded company that'll be open well over 60 hours in a single week. Getting this up and running is my full time job. I have two decades of corporate experience, an MBA from a top school, and have been involved in several successful startups, albeit none in retail. I always include a pitch deck in my initial outreach that explains the concept, gives a bit of my background, and has a fair bit of financials. I’m currently reworking it to lead with financials in hopes that fully acknowedging the perceived risk will help. Any thoughts on how to change the approach?",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1okdg7d/retail_space_lease_guidance/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

Gen Z love 'Pinteresty' and 'Insta-worthy' gifts, but also like something at a low price point. And what can be the products I can launch? My ideal target audience is between 17-31.

1of593v,2025-10-24T18:19:14,startups,The ONLY AI-resistant startup marketing playbook that still scales - I will not promote,"Are your inbound conversions crashing? SEO not working anymore? Sales down? Here's why, and how you can fix it. Note: No AI was used to write this. # The Internet as we knew it no longer exists. **Marketing playbooks from the last 20 years? No longer relevant.** I can’t tell you how many startups haven’t realized they’re using marketing playbooks that are dated and don’t work anymore. All founders know is that sales are down or nonexistent, they aren’t increasing deal flow like they used to, and nothing seems to work anymore. # The reason? Artificial Intelligence (AI) search, and greedy social media companies have already broken marketing. Content is still important, but what has worked for the past 20 years ***does not work*** anymore. **Inbound is DEAD.** People are searching more than ever, but they are asking AI, which then answers them. Most people aren’t visiting websites anymore hunting for answers or solutions. AI is simply giving them an answer on a silver platter. I personally don’t even use Google anymore, it is the equivalent of reading the Yellow Pages compared to AI search. Meanwhile, the traffic you do get from AI search results, although it is high intent, the volume does not compare to the organic search traffic we used to get. For every 100 people you used to get from organic search traffic, you now maybe get 1 person from AI search results. The volume just isn’t there because people aren’t digging into websites for answers anymore. Inbound just doesn’t work anymore in an AI world and most people haven’t figured this out yet. **Social won’t let you link to anything.** Meanwhile, X, TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook have all significantly reduced reach, even to your own followers, and optimized their platforms for engagement so users do not leave. In other words, you can’t link to your own website or products or services anymore without these social media algorithms sending your links and content into a blackhole. I had a project I was working on recently, and I had a post go viral on Instagram with over 28,000+ organic views. Do you know how many people visited the website? 4. How many sales? Zero. Meanwhile, I get thousands of views on my LinkedIn account per month, and almost no one ever goes to my website. YouTube and Reddit are the only actual content platforms left that matter anymore. Even then, they both suffer from serious limitations and are difficult or impossible to scale. Reddit is a random cluster of chaos where every community has different rules, and YouTube is a treadmill that forces you to run faster and faster until you cannot keep up anymore. Either way, spending time on organic social media is an absolute waste of time for 98% of startups and companies. Don’t get me wrong, the 1-2% who nail it can make a dent and get some seriously free traffic, but it requires serious effort, time, and luck. ***So what does work now?*** **Personalized and Hypertargeted Advertising** Would you rather have 100,000 peop...",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1of593v/the_only_airesistant_startup_marketing_playbook/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

No surprise I mean can you imagine working with Kendall Jenner to promote Notion/Canva ?? Don't get me wrong, she still has her appeal etc but when you work with these big celebrities, their endorsements are plenty and tend to feel less authentic. Now, the tricky part is actually how to scale outreach without messaging hundreds of nano-influencers manually. (After you also spent thousand of hours reviewing their content, I am pretty sure you guys have experienced this...). Personally, we started experimenting with tools like ParseBear and Aspire to help automate the discovery and outreach. Why? Becuz honestly when you're running a business, you don't want to spend so many hours finding and then chasing influencers. It's one of those little hacks that save hours, similar to how Cursor saved so much time for me as a developer... Really can't imagine my life without all these different tools esp as a startup when you have to move fast and yet time is still never enough.. Life back then was simpler but harder defo without them. What do you guys think? Do you guys experiment with working with these nano-influencers too as part of trying to grow your startups??",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1odawss/the_biggest_opportunity_right_now_in_marketing/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1odan04,2025-10-22T14:59:39,startups,"Seeking Advice on Land Verification Business Idea in Dehradun, UP – Worth Building?(i will not promote)","I’m planning to start a Land verification business in Dehradun, UP, leveraging background as a land revenue officer and have a network of lawyers and dealers to help buyers verify property titles and avoid fraud. The idea is to provide thorough, affordable, and fast title verification services for real estate buyers, focusing on the local market. I’d love your feedback on whether this is worth pursuing and any red flags or suggestions you see! The Problem Property fraud is rampant in India, especially in tier-2 cities like Dehradun. Buyers lose crores due to fake titles, disputed ownership, or hidden encumbrances. Most buyers lack the expertise to verify land records, and existing services are either too expensive (₹25K+) or too slow (15+ days). National companies don’t focus on local markets like Dehradun, creating a gap for a specialized, affordable service. The Solution A property verification service that: Charges ₹10-15K per case (vs. ₹25K-1L) by competitors). Delivers reports in 7 days (vs. 15+ days). Leverages my expertise for credibility and accuracy. Focuses on Dehradun/UP, with plans to scale to nearby cities (Noida, Lucknow). Targets real estate agents, builders, and banks for steady referrals.",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1odan04/seeking_advice_on_land_verification_business_idea/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1oarz41,2025-10-19T15:07:24,marketing,Marketers are wasting 70% of their ad budget on low-attention media,"Chances are, you are overspending your budget on social media: 70% of total ad spend goes to low-attention platforms where ads must make an impact in less than 2 seconds. Yet purchase intent increases by 40% when ads appear in premium media (the Trade Desk and PA consulting June 2025). As per the report, The Economist, Disney+, and Spotify stand out as premium media thanks to their high-quality content, uncluttered interface and non-disruptive ad integration. What do these brands have in common? They're not social media. − social media = low-attention with approx. 2 seconds average attention paid to an ad. − newsbrands, books and other premium media = high-attention with 3 to 9 seconds of focused engagement. Paid expert are chasing the wrong sweet spot: − low attention: sufficient for brand recall. − high attention: required for brand favorability. Attention metrics don't predict sales. But when measured with ad resonance, context and user focus, attention metrics are 8x better at predicting brand recall and 4x better at predicting brand favorability than simple exposure (Snapchat, WPP Media and Lumen research). So why do marketers spend more on high-reach, low-attention channels when a mere 5% increase in attention can lead to up to 2X gains in brand perception? Is it a question of habit, scale or an obsession with impressions?",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1oarz41/marketers_are_wasting_70_of_their_ad_budget_on/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1o92ywe,2025-10-17T14:34:00,marketing,My Thoughts on Meta's Andromeda (And How To Succeed),"Alright y’all, I’ve been seeing a million posts on Reddit talking about Andromeda, how Meta has destroyed ad campaigns, and people speaking of their budgets getting royally f&%ked. After spending the past few weeks rebuilding \~$2M/mo in ad account spend, and since Andromeda has been hitting my campaigns at different times (seems to have been slowly released and hit more/less aggressively by industry and spend amount) – I had to look at this in first principles. So I dove way too deep into Meta’s engineering blog and then spoke with a few, far more impressive Meta ads peeps I’m friendly with. Then I even chatted with someone high up at Meta and got the inside scoop. Here’s my honest take on what’s going on with Facebook Ads right now. More importantly, I think it’s important to look forward on the ‘who, what, and why’ before we all panic. \#1 | **You’re not crazy and Zuck doesn’t really care about ads** You didn’t see a drop off because of your pixel. It wasn’t iOS. It wasn’t your ad creatives being improperly sized or your CTA or anything else. It was **Meta quietly changing their algorithm without explicitly telling anyone.** I don’t particularly respect this, as Zuck has no problem going on podcasts to discuss their Glasses which have like 10k customers. But for the ad engine that accounts for 20-30% of global ad spend, they drop a quiet blog. Shame Zuck, shame. I’ve long since suspected Zuck really doesn’t give a shit about ads. I genuinely believe Zuck makes it nearly impossible to spend your money unless you're an extremely large account (and thus has an account executive). But then I'll see people who are already spending many millions on Meta and ***still*** don't have any kind of AE. It seems like the barrier to have a dedicated Meta AE is like tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in spend. Shockingly, I don't understand why! For example, I've had multiple clients who are ready and willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars a month, but for whatever reason, it's impossible to get their account restricted. It's almost always for the most unnecessary and useless account restrictions. I am ready and willing to spend money on your platform, and yet the entire customer support staff is like 3 women in the Phillippines. **#2 | Zuck understands there are 4 stakeholders in the Meta advertising customer journey:** Creative/Creators > Marketer > CTA/Landing Page > Customer Zuck’s job is in matching core customer characteristics (behavior, readiness to buy, income, misc dopamine factors). This is 10x harder than Google, which can essentially force a bottom of funnel sale. Zuck needs to ensure the ad is good enough to convince you to leave your (already hyper addictive) IG page. That’s a tough problem to crack! Also, Zuck has realized a lot of the marketing spend is based around people who are not very impressive - clearly not as impressive as his elite team of ML and AI researchers – and they have old held beliefs. Theoretically, his team sho...",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1o92ywe/my_thoughts_on_metas_andromeda_and_how_to_succeed/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1okljpl,2025-10-31T04:39:35,UXDesign,Mid-level UX designer feeling stuck (and kinda like an imposter) — could use some advice 🙃,"Hey everyone, I’ve been doing UX since 2020 mostly freelance work and writing UX-related articles on Medium. I’m technically a mid-level designer now, but honestly… I still feel like an imposter sometimes. 😅 I know I’ve grown a lot. The way I see apps, websites, and products now is totally different than when I started. When I worked for Samsung’s partner company, I even gave feedback on their website UX during meetings stuff that made total sense but they never updated it (probably budget issues). The thing is… I help other designers all the time. I mentor junior designers, give them feedback, help them with their portfolios and they always thank me for it. But when it comes to my own portfolio, I freeze. It looks outdated and “junior,” and every time I try to update it, I get stuck. I don’t even know where to start anymore. I’ve made some connections in the industry, even a few senior designers (one of them actually works on the Apple website), and I have a meeting tomorrow with another senior Apple designer. He told me he’s not sure how he can help, but I still want to pick his brain a bit. It’s been 4–5 years since I started this journey. There was a point where I kinda gave up because the job market felt impossible and, well, it still kind of is. I’ve even thought about starting a YouTube channel to get some exposure or share my process, but I’m not sure if that’s the right move. If anyone’s been in this “mid-level but still lost” phase, how did you get yourself unstuck? How did you rebuild confidence or refresh your portfolio when you didn’t have shiny new projects to show?

1ojt5ba,2025-10-30T07:18:54,UXDesign,Approach to User Journeys,"This is kind of a rant. And I want to know if this something that is widely observed. I am a UX designer working in India in a consulting agency. I've noticed that many of my design peers, when asked to make a user journey to redesign or improve a product, they invariably make the journey page-wise. Even while conducting quick UX audits of a website or product, they observe it one page at a time. This follows into redesigning existing pages, maybe adding or removing a few. The end result however, is a very disjointed experience. The page on its own looks better, but when I want to operate it, click this, navigate here, find something, purchase something, subscribe, unsubscribe, login, or logout, the experience falls apart. While presenting audit findings or solution ideations to the client, a more experience focused project manager will more often than not ask these questions, which is when the design falls apart. Journeys rarely involve one page only. They go beyond pages. Theyre just steps to perform a task which fulfills a user need. I agree the page-wise approach is much faster because it involves mostly cosmetic fixes with few UX enhancements. And it doesn't add or remove from the bulk of the work. But I can't stand working like this. Even most UX leads and senior designers in my workplace work like this. Is this something you've observed in other companies across India? Or maybe other countries too? I would also point out that very few clients and project managers are experience focused. Theyre either feature focused or are comfortable with the page-wise approach.

1odj1n0,2025-10-22T20:08:50,UXDesign,I’m Done With UX- Quitting my Job,"This is not a dramatic post. It’s just me being real about where I am right now. I’ve been working as a Product Designer for 5 years now mostly in startups across web3, metaverse, e-commerce and many more. I didn’t start out in design. I actually wanted to be a software engineer but realized in college it wasn’t for me. I had good design aptitude, so I explored it, learned on my own, and somehow landed my first role. I was excited finally doing something creative, something that mixed tech and design. Fast forward to now , 5 years in and I dread opening my laptop for work. I’m not lazy. I’ve worked hard, took layoffs on the chin, learned new tools, freelanced, kept building my portfolio. But I’ve lost all motivation to continue in this field. Here’s why: 1: There are not enough jobs. Everywhere I look, it’s the same story , UX roles are shrinking. Even on big company career pages, you barely see “UX Designer” listings anymore. The few that exist get thousands of applicants. The competition is insane 2: Layoffs. I’ve been laid off twice, both times not because of my work, but because the project ended or business got bad. And designers are always the first ones to go. “Once the project is up and out, you’re not required anymore.” 3: It’s a never-ending loop. Find a job → work hard → build portfolio → get laid off → start again. This constant cycle of instability kills your confidence. The thought that 3–4 years from now, if I lose another job, I’ll have to start over again like it’s college… it’s terrifying. I don’t think I’ll have that kind of energy then, especially with more responsibilities in life. 4: There’s barely any real UX work. At least not in startups. You hear all this talk about empathy, research, user testing , but in reality? You’re just pushing pixels. Everyone around you has an opinion on design, and your decisions are overridden by “what the founder likes.” You don’t tell a developer how to code, but everyone feels qualified to tell a designer how something should look. I don’t even remember the last time I made proper wireframes or had time for user interviews. It’s all assumptions and guesswork, and then we call it “UX.” 5: AI tools are replacing us fast. My current company uses Lovable, and they’re pretty okay with whatever it generates , even when it’s bad. They just want something to roll out quickly. When you’re working on enterprise products, no one even cares if it looks nice. “Pretty screens” that’s all they think we do anyway. 6: And the salary? It sucks. The pay for designers in India is honestly not worth the amount of effort, stress, and uncertainty. Developers and PMs make double or triple, and you’re here constantly proving your worth every single day. I know some people will say I’m being negative or whiny, but this is the reality. I really loved design once. I wanted to grow in this field, maybe even work remotely for international companies. But there just aren’t enough opportunities especially compared to soft...",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1odj1n0/im_done_with_ux_quitting_my_job/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

At my current job, I'm employed as a UX and UI designer, but everyone sees me and our other UI designers as 'designers'. They think we are fashion designers who can pick out clothes and design them for events and conferences. They think we are photographers and can take photos of people and the daily business. They think we are interior designers who can choose new furniture for the office and make it look nicer. They think we are exhibition stand designers and builders and that we can design a whole booth, choose decorations, and come up with interactive ideas for it. They think we are copywriters and can write the text for the happy birthday card they want to send to all employees. I'm not sure if I should feel honoured that they think I can do all of this, even though there are whole professions for these tasks. And I really can't see why I would be better at choosing a shirt and putting our company logo on it than the HR person who came up with the idea for this gift. They could have just used the time they spent writing the ticket to open one of those online shirt design tools, upload our logo, and choose one of the predefined positions for it and hit 'order'. If my drunk friend Patrick can do this at midnight in a pub with his favourite sports team's slogan, I don't see why Rachel from HR can't do it. **Is there a good, professional way to shut down these requests?** I really want to make our software more userfriendly, but people seem to think that socks with our company logo on them are more important than that — even my boss.",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1o97i3e/how_to_stop_beeing_the_designer/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

I’m looking for an iOS Swift developer to help me fix a background playback issue with YouTube videos in my app. Here’s the situation: I have a Swift-based iOS app that plays YouTube videos (WKWebView). The video plays fine while the app is in the foreground. I’ve already enabled “Background Modes → Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture” in Xcode. I’ve also tried setting the AVAudioSession to .playback. However, when I leave the app or lock the screen, playback stops automatically. It only resumes if I manually open Control Center or the Home Screen and press “Play.” What I need: I want the video’s audio to continue playing automatically in the background when the app goes inactive (like how music streaming apps like Spotify behave). The app should not require the user to manually press play again after going to the Home Screen. This should work on any youtube video I paste the url link to. All I need is a simple bug fix.

1oknbw8,2025-10-31T06:31:06,india,Why Indians should check for Insulin Resistance before diabetes hits,"I’m not a doctor — just someone who personally believes I might have insulin resistance and have been reading a lot about it lately. In India, diabetes runs in almost every family. But what most people don’t realize is that the problem often starts years before as insulin resistance (IR) — when your body produces more and more insulin just to keep your blood sugar normal. Eventually, the body can’t keep up, and that’s when diabetes officially “appears.” The sad part? Most doctors don’t suggest preventive tests for insulin resistance. They’ll only treat you after you develop diabetes. But if we catch insulin resistance early, it’s completely reversible with diet and lifestyle changes — no fancy medicine needed. The scary part is that most clinics and labs in India only offer HOMA-IR, which measures fasting insulin and glucose. In early stages, those can look completely normal. The more accurate test — the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with insulin levels — shows how your insulin really spikes after a glucose drink, but very few labs provide it. We spend so much money on unnecessary things — clothes, gadgets, fancy shoes, eating out — but hesitate when it comes to simple preventive tests that could protect our future health. If you have a family history of diabetes, or signs like a dark neck (acanthosis nigricans), PCOS, belly fat, or sudden fatigue after meals, please get checked for insulin resistance. If insulin resistance is caught early and corrected, it can help prevent diabetes and so many other metabolic problems. Yet our healthcare system mostly waits until people already have a disease before taking action. It would be so much better if we focused on preventing instead of treating. I used ChatGPT to articulate this better.",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1oknbw8/why_indians_should_check_for_insulin_resistance/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1okmkz1,2025-10-31T05:41:56,india,Why is it that many people in India still struggle to grasp the idea of quality of life?,"Having spent a good chunk of my life in military stations, I think that’s why the outside world feels so overwhelming to me. Life inside a cantonment is… well, it’s a different ball game. The roads are spotless, traffic flows smoothly, dogs are vaccinated and well-behaved, garbage gets picked up every day, and there’s this unspoken respect among everyone. Kids can play freely in the streets, officers and jawans exchange polite greetings, and there’s a certain rhythm to life — calm, orderly, and dignified. But then you step outside those gates — into what we call “civil life” — and it’s like you’ve landed on another planet. It’s as if people here have made chaos their default mode. Traffic jams are so common that folks have started scheduling their days around them. Pedestrians stroll on the roads as if they have nine lives, while drivers honk like the horn is a magic button that gives them extra speed. Driving here isn’t just about getting from point A to B; it’s a battle for survival. Everyone’s in a hurry, yet no one seems to be making any real progress. Lane discipline? That’s just a fairy tale. Red lights? Optional. Zebra crossings? Merely a suggestion. And the police? They seem completely unfazed. They’ll stop a 17-year-old on a scooter to check for a “license and RC,” but won’t bat an eye when an overloaded government bus swerves across three lanes, nearly causing an accident. As for auto drivers? They navigate the roads like they’re on a suicide mission, probably with some political backing. And heaven help you if a VIP decides to take your route — suddenly, your time, your frustration, your fuel, and your sanity don’t matter at all. Roads get blocked, police are stationed every few meters, and you find yourself stuck in traffic while some politician waves from an air-conditioned car, trying to show how much he “cares for the people.” It’s astonishing how people can keep their homes spotless yet treat public spaces like they’re personal trash cans. You’ll see someone sweeping their doorstep in the morning, only to toss their garbage right on the corner of the same street. Street dogs and cows wander around, munching on plastic and garbage. Dead animals lie unattended for days, while people stroll by as if it’s just part of the landscape. And then you’ll hear someone chime in, “India is a spiritual country.” Sure, spiritual — but seems to have a serious allergy to responsibility. Every few weeks, there’s something that clogs up the roads: A political rally where the leader talks about progress while his event literally brings the city to a standstill. A visarjan or baraat that turns the streets into dance floors. A festival where people set off firecrackers like they’re declaring war on the environment. After Diwali, the AQI skyrockets to 400+, and suddenly everyone’s an environmentalist on Twitter — “why only question our religion?” — while they’re coughing their lungs out the next morning.

1okkeqm,2025-10-31T03:38:15,india,Chandigarh a true balance between nature & modernity,"Since childhood, I’ve lived between two different worlds, the serene green and planned Chandigarh and the dense concrete jungle of ***Delhi & Gurgaon. I would go to school wearing a mask, in Gurgaon’s dystopian atmosphere,*** sticking only to rooms with air purifiers, terrified to go outside into the grey, smoke-filled outdoors. ***Vacations in Chandigarh were an escape to nature, as we could walk through open, green parks.*** One of my earliest memories is visiting the Rock Garden. As a child, I was enchanted by this strange, whimsical world, which seemed like a playground built from imagination. Looking back, I realise how visionary it truly was; a creation ahead of its time, turning waste into wonder long before recycling or sustainability became mainstream. In a way, the Rock Garden captures the real spirit of Chandigarh: creative, thoughtful and committed to conscious impact. For me, Chandigarh’s green spaces also hold a personal meaning - my grandfather served as the city’s head of horticulture. Some of my fondest memories are of visiting the parks and gardens he helped design and nurture. Even after he passed away, visiting these spaces felt like revisiting his living legacy rooted in the soil and the city he loved. It was also in one of these parks that my grandmother taught me how to ride a bike. These gardens became more than just beautiful spaces - they became the foundation for my understanding that environmental stewardship is both deeply personal and enduringly meaningful. ***Chandigarh is a model of environmental sustainability in India, with multiple progressive policies, and infrastructure that embed sustainability into the city’s very design, from solar rooftops to green belts.*** What always struck me most was the sense of balance the city seemed to hold, between nature and modernity, structure and spontaneity. Every sector had its own rhythm, its own ecosystem of trees, parks, and open spaces. Cycling tracks lined with flowering trees, roundabouts blooming in spring, and streets that never felt too crowded, Chandigarh offered room to breathe, think, and exist at a pace that felt innately human. Over time, I began to understand that Chandigarh isn’t just well-planned, it’s intentional. ***It takes effort, from both the administration and its citizens, to keep the city true to its vision.*** For instance, the Chandigarh Renewable Energy and Science & Technology Promotion Society (CREST) has been driving the city toward cleaner energy through initiatives like the solar panel mandate. The transition is not without challenges; solar installations can be expensive, and retrofitting old buildings takes time. Yet, the persistence of both the people and policymakers shows a shared commitment to sustainability that few cities can match. Chandigarh stands as proof that when governance and community work hand in hand, sustainability can move from aspiration to reality.

1okaqo0,2025-10-30T20:27:41,india,Has India’s idea of political unity evolved with changing media and identity politics?,"I have been wondering how the meaning of political unity in India has changed over the decades and whether what we are seeing today is just an extension of older patterns or something fundamentally new. Since independence, political mobilization here has always drawn upon identity, whether caste, religion, region or language. That is part of the country’s democratic DNA, a side effect of its enormous diversity. Yet the way identity plays out in public life seems very different now. What once operated mostly during elections, when leaders would appeal to certain communities or regions for votes, has turned into something more continuous. The lines that used to fade after polling season now remain active through television debates, social media trends, WhatsApp forwards, influencer content and even everyday conversations. It feels as if polarization has shifted from being a temporary tactic to becoming part of the cultural atmosphere itself. This change might not be about any single party or ideology but rather about how new forms of communication have altered the rhythm of politics. When news is consumed in real time, every minor disagreement can be turned into an identity question, and the old idea of consensus begins to look slow or weak. Political campaigns no longer end when the votes are counted because the narrative machinery keeps running year round, shaping how people imagine the nation and who belongs within it. Whether this is simply an unavoidable consequence of mass media and algorithmic amplification or a deeper ideological evolution in how we see community and difference is hard to tell. India’s unity has always been noisy and contested, but perhaps what is changing now is the intensity and permanence of those contests. The tools that once helped hold together a vast, argumentative democracy are the same ones now making every argument louder. Maybe that is not decline but transformation, a sign that political identity in the digital age never really sleeps.",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1okaqo0/has_indias_idea_of_political_unity_evolved_with/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1ok9dyo,2025-10-30T19:35:13,india,"Hospital Negligence: My Mom’s Ordeal — Two Surgeries, Sleepless Nights, and Trauma Since 14 October","I am writing this because my mom and our entire family have been living through a nightmare since 14th October 2025, after what should have been a routine surgery at one of the most reputed hospital chains in South India, especially Hyderabad. My mom was operated on by a senior gynecologist, who also happens to be the wife of the owner of that hospital branch. What followed has been nothing short of traumatic, a series of sleepless nights, unanswered questions, delayed reports, and ultimately, a second major surgery to correct a mistake that should never have happened. 14 October (Monday) My mom underwent a laparoscopic removal of uterus and ovaries (hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy). The surgery was performed by the senior gynecologist mentioned above, and we were told that everything went perfectly fine. We were relieved and trusted the hospital’s reputation completely. 16 October (Wednesday) She was discharged, even though she still complained of abdominal pain and discomfort. When we expressed concern, the hospital staff told us that this was “normal” after such a surgery. 17–18 October (Thursday–Friday) Her bloating worsened and she was unable to pass motions. We called the hospital to report this — they casually advised a laxative. After taking it, she suffered 10–12 episodes of loose stools on 18 October, became extremely weak, and we had to rush her to the Emergency Room (ER). In the ER, they gave her IV fluids and painkillers, did some blood tests (CBP, electrolytes, ECG), and removed all antibiotics from her discharge medication. She was then sent home. 20–22 October (Sunday–Tuesday) Over the next few days, her abdominal bloating increased again, and she developed severe back pain. We were getting worried because she still hadn’t returned to normal and was becoming weaker. 23 October (Wednesday) We went back to meet the same gynecologist. She removed the surgical stitches and tapes, said “everything looks fine”, and told us that the back pain would settle down in a few days. That same night, my mom developed a high-grade fever. We immediately called the hospital, but were told to just give Dolo 650 and monitor her. The fever came down temporarily but the pain and bloating persisted. 24–25 October (Thursday–Friday) The high fever returned within hours of giving Dolo. My mom was in visible distress — she couldn’t sleep, had severe pain, and her stomach looked visibly swollen. We knew something was seriously wrong. 25 October (Saturday) We rushed her to the ER again. This time, an oncology surgeon (apparently close to the gynecologist) examined her and ordered an ultrasound. The ultrasound report showed: “Large fluid collection in the abdomen — lesion, septated collection, hematoma, gross ascites with internal echoes (infective).” The oncology surgeon immediately advised admission and told us not to give her anything orally (“nil by mouth”). At that point, we noticed visible panic among the hospital staff.

1ok8qxp,2025-10-30T19:10:50,india,Should Chennai have a directly elected mayor? Our monsoon chaos makes me think so.,"The recent rains in Chennai weren’t even that heavy, yet the city practically came to a standstill. Roads flooded, traffic jammed, power cuts everywhere—it’s the same old story. A few hours of rain, and the city slips into crisis mode. It makes you wonder if we are ever truly prepared for the monsoon. Year after year, the same promises come up: better stormwater drains, smarter planning, improved coordination. And yet, the Coovum River continues to run like a city-wide embarrassment—a sewage channel cutting through Chennai’s core, barely touched despite decades of plans and projects. The real issue seems to be accountability. The Chennai mayor’s office is treated more like an extended PR arm of the state government rather than an independent executive body. Every initiative feels orchestrated, press conferences are choreographed, and the mayor often ends up playing the role of a city mascot rather than an empowered leader. It’s like watching the office being led around on a leash, with no autonomy to actually fix what’s broken. What’s even more frustrating is how the state machinery uses every monsoon crisis as an opportunity for social media PR. Ministers and political heirs wade through knee-deep water for photo-ops, issue dramatic statements, and post drone shots of “on-ground inspections.” The focus is rarely on fixing systemic failures—just on crafting the right viral moment. While citizens slog through flooded streets, the ruling class turns disaster management into a brand campaign. In countries like the UK and Canada—both parliamentary democracies like India—cities have directly elected mayors who possess genuine authority. London and Toronto, for example, give their mayors real mandates to plan, execute, and be held accountable by the people, not the ruling party machinery. Maybe it’s time Tamil Nadu, and India at large, considers doing the same. A directly elected mayor for Chennai could bring much-needed political independence and real accountability to urban governance. Or is that too much power for state governments to ever willingly give up?",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ok8qxp/should_chennai_have_a_directly_elected_mayor_our/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1ok8532,2025-10-30T18:48:06,india,I'm so tired of the workplace discrimination I have to face,"I'll try my best to make it as short as possible. I'm at Bengaluru, I joined this company last year and the majority of the team was from a particular south indian state (Not kannadiga or Telugu) including the manager. I'm from Kerala and I was always sidelined when it came to projects and growth. Manager just hates me for no reason despite me trying my best to talk it out with him. Out of the last 4 people that resigned last month, 3 were from the minority state and the others that replaced them were all from this state. So I used to hang around with this other bunch who were the anti-majority guys (North Indian group) and I used to get a lot of hate from the majority guys (yes micromanagement here is so bad and workplace is so toxic that you will be monitored for when you go to the toilet, who you hang out with etc.) but these North people agreed to take me in their project. But then I started to realise that things were not all roses with these people either. The Team lead would steal all credit and threarten to kick me out of the project if I spoke up, saying ""you know your situation with them, if I kick you out of this project you'll never get another one"" and show partiality to the other guys that are from the North. Basically taking advantage of my situation. The only other Malayali guys I trusted all left thanks to the torture here. Last week when we all came back from Diwali, they (The North guys group) were discussing about how their Diwali went, and when I tried to indulge I got told ""Tum toh Kerala se ho, tumhara kya Diwali? Diwali toh hamara dharm ka hai, tum vaha se ho tum hamara dharm ka nhi ho"" and that was so hurtful cuz yes I am from kerala but I am a Hindu and I do celebrate Diwali but still according to them I am from that particularn state so I don't belong to theor ""Dharm"". I am a vegetarian and I get told by these guys that I am pseudo vegetarian because I am from Kerala. Just because of that. During team dinner, when i try sitting with the other guys I get told that ""you are vegetarian shift to another table"" like bro, I am vegetarian ok but that doesn't mean I can't sit near a non veg and these North gang would also push me out saying ""Tum Malayali tum log sab kuch khate hai yha mat ao"".

Water harvesting, local materials, and seasonal diets weren’t trends ,they were life. Yet, when the West does it, it’s called innovation; when India does it, it’s dismissed as backward. What many in metros forget is that progress isn’t instant. It’s slower here because every change comes with trade-offs, costs, and competing priorities. It’s not as simple as “I saw it abroad, let’s just do it here.” Real change needs time, context, and understanding. Maybe that’s the real issue , metro India doesn’t seek progress as much as it seeks approval.

1ok28kd,2025-10-30T15:07:41,india,Why Indians haven't woken up yet?,"India is going through a lot right now — the electoral bonds scam, deforestation in the Hasdeo forest, voting scams, farmer suicides caused by middlemen and debt, civil conflict in Manipur, an environmental crisis across most of the country, severe pollution, protests in Ladakh, the ethanol scam, Adani’s land grabs in Bihar, and so on. Even basic issues like poor infrastructure, inadequate sanitation, bribery, corruption, labor rights violations, unemployment, and mass displacement remain unresolved. Yet, despite all this, Indians aren’t expressing outrage or holding the government accountable. The reason is simple — media control. That’s why people aren’t “waking up,” and why Indian society is gradually devolving into racism, sectarianism, and ethnic conflict. Most of the major media houses are owned by just two billionaires — Ambani and Adani — who have profited immensely under the Modi government. The logic is straightforward: since they benefit from this administration, they influence media outlets to act as propaganda arms for the BJP. These channels deliberately hide the government’s failures, and when they do report on them, they deflect blame onto the opposition or unrelated factors. When citizens protest to demand accountability, they’re met with police brutality, detained without warrants, and then labeled by the media as “anti-nationals,” “foreign-funded,” “anti-Hindu,” or “CIA/ISI/Chinese agents.” As a result, most Indians don’t even know about these scams — the electoral bonds scam, the voting scam, or the ethanol scam — or that they even exist. The media constantly targets the opposition while glorifying the Modi government. They’ve turned politics into hero worship, with actual songs comparing Modi to a divine reincarnation. During national crises, instead of focusing on the real issues, the media stokes hatred — especially anti-Muslim propaganda — radicalizing large parts of the population. Another major factor is social media. After the internet became cheap and widely accessible around 2016, the government saw an opportunity. Most new users weren’t digitally literate, so the BJP’s IT cell flooded social media with bot accounts to spread hateful propaganda. It worked frighteningly well, radicalizing millions. Over time, the situation only worsened — today, the government even pays influencers, analysts, and so-called experts to defend its policies using complicated jargon that sounds intelligent but ultimately means nothing, just to justify draconian decisions as “National security.” I have so much more to rant about, I have so much more to say, the things are so bad right now and nobody cares, this thing terrifies me, and I felt helpless, so, I can only rant about this situation.",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ok28kd/why_indians_havent_woken_up_yet/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

What I saw and what I figured out,"**7 Impossible Claims, 7 Perfect Hits: How a Dakla Ceremony Almost Made Me Believe** I'm an engineer from Gujarat. I don't believe in superstition. I believe in data, logic, and evidence. But on one night in October 2025, I saw things that made me question everything. 120 people. One temple. Hours of daklas. Three people shaking violently, claiming to be possessed by our family goddess. And then—seven specific claims about our family history. All of them true. Every single one. I was there. I saw it with my own eyes. And for a moment—just a moment—I believed. Here's what I saw. Here's what I figured out. And here's why it matters. # ACT 1: THE SETUP **The Problem** My extended family—250 people across five generations, spread across 15-20 houses in rural Gujarat—was suffering. Cancer diagnoses. Debt. Broken marriages. Deaths that felt too soon, too sudden. The kind of pain that makes you search for reasons. For patterns. For someone to blame. And the answer they arrived at? Our family goddess (kuldevi) was angry. Or an ancestor's spirit was taking revenge. Or some malevolent force was haunting us. The family elders made a decision: we'd organize a dakla ceremony at our family temple. **The Expert Arrives** A man was invited from a village 120 km away. His job? When dakla players perform and someone becomes possessed—by a goddess, an ancestor, or a troubled spirit—he communicates with them to seek answers. No information about our family was shared with him beforehand. This is important. Remember that. **The Ceremony Begins** Night fell. The daklas started. *Boom. Boom. Boom.* The sound was hypnotic. Relentless. The kind of rhythm that gets into your bones. Around 120 people sat in the temple courtyard, watching. Waiting. And then, it started. # ACT 2: THE EVIDENCE **Part A: The Possession** Three people began to shake. Violently. Their bodies convulsing, heads rolling, eyes unfocused. Two of them were regulars at these ceremonies—men in their 30s and 40s who'd been ""possessed"" before. But the third? A 16-year-old boy who'd never experienced this before the event. Now he was shaking like electricity was running through him. **Part B: The Number Trick** Then came the first test. A family member went into the inner temple, took blessings from the goddess, and wrote a number from 1 to 4 on his palm. Nobody else saw it. Not the expert. Not the possessed. Nobody. He came back out. One of the possessed men spoke: **""Two.""** The family member opened his palm. It was 2. The crowd gasped. I felt my stomach drop. **Part C: The Failures** But then... things got weird. They tried another test. This time, selecting a specific person from the crowd. The possessed tried. And failed. They tried again with grains of wheat—3000 to 5000 grains spread out, and the possessed had to identify which one had been marked. They tried. Once. Twice. Three times. Eight to ten attempts total. Every single time: failure. The expert's explanation? ""The goddess isn't happy yet.

1ojw25q,2025-10-30T10:30:00,india,Struggling to get the Job?,"Hi everyone, My girlfriend worked in an MNC for around 1 year in the mainframe domain in Bengaluru. In 2023, she had to resign because of serious health issues. At that time, her health mattered more than anything, and I was the one who encouraged her to step back and recover fully which regretting myself. Thankfully, she’s much better now and ready to get back to work. But over the last year, she’s been trying really hard to restart her career applying everywhere, attending interviews, reaching out to recruiters, and even trying through both her and my network. Despite all this effort, she’s not been able to find a single genuine opportunity. The issue everyone keeps pointing out is her career gap. It’s disheartening because she’s technically skilled, motivated, and willing to start even from the bottom again. She’s not being picky at all she’s open to any IT-related role now, not just mainframe (testing, support, backend, QA, data, anything). She just wants a fair chance to prove herself again. But it’s been frustrating because most companies either ghost her or reject her immediately after noticing the break. To make it worse, several people we spoke to have suggested the so-called “backdoor” route basically paying someone or faking experience to get a job. Some even claim that’s the “only realistic way” now. We’re absolutely not okay with that. We don’t want to go through dishonest or fake means it might give short-term results, but it’s not right, and it can backfire later. We just want to do this honestly. So, Is backdoor the only option left after a gap? Or are there genuine, proven ways for someone with around 1 year of MNC experience to restart an IT career honestly, even after a break? If you’ve been through something like this or helped someone who was, please share what actually worked. Here’s what we’ve already tried: Job portals (Naukri, LinkedIn, etc.) updated resume, applied daily. Contacted recruiters and hiring managers on LinkedIn. Attended a few interviews, but most didn’t progress because of the “gap.” Tried networking through friends and ex-colleagues no luck so far. She’s open to reskilling or Returnship or comeback programs, if any actually exist and hire We’ve seen a few “women comeback” or “career restart” programs online, but many look inactive or are only for people with more years of experience. If anyone knows companies that genuinely run active returnship programs in India (IT domain), please drop some names or links. We’d also love tips on how to present the gap positively on her resume maybe something like mentioning it was a health recovery period, or listing learning/training done during that time. I know there are many people out there who’ve faced breaks for health, family, or personal reasons and it’s really tough to get a fair second chance in IT. We’re not expecting miracles, just some honest direction from people who’ve seen this before.

Anantha Nageswaran, seems pretty upbeat about the country’s growth prospects. In a recent statement, he said that India’s GDP is likely to grow around 7% in FY26, thanks to a mix of policy support, resilience, and steady domestic demand, even as the world faces multiple economic headwinds. He pointed out that three global rating agencies have recently upgraded India’s outlook, and if things stay on track, the country could soon break into the ‘A’ credit rating category. That’s a big deal because it signals stronger economic credibility and could attract more long-term foreign investments. According to him, policy measures like income tax reliefs and GST rationalisation have boosted consumer spending and business sentiment this year. Interestingly, earlier in February, he expected growth to fall to around 6%, especially after US tariff hikes, but things seem to have improved since then. On the question of slow bank credit growth, he said we shouldn’t just look at bank loans in isolation. When you factor in the money flowing through non-bank lenders, commercial papers, certificates of deposit, and equity markets, the overall resource mobilisation in the economy has actually grown by a solid 28.5% per year over the last six years, as per RBI data.

I told him I haven't received anything (email or refund) and he continues to repeat that an email is sent from his side. I requested him to forward or resend that email and he said its not possible as it was automated. I asked him to show some proof of communication and he refused, claiming he cannot forward an automated email or take a screenshot/photo. I asked about the money and he told it was refunded and he will share the ARA number which I can use to check with my bank. I asked him to send it to me and he said he cant send it but rather only dictate it over the call as he is not authorized to send via email or message. He was also not willing to escalate this issue to someone who had more authority. Pathetic customer service and seems like a scam at this point!!

1oj2iur,2025-10-29T11:57:20,india,Need help to choose between - CAT vs startup vs Job,"Hey everyone, I’m feeling a bit stuck and could really use some advice or perspective. I graduated in May 2025 and decided to take a gap year. I’ve been preparing for CAT, but honestly, the preparation hasn’t been going as well as I hoped. Realistically, I think I might score somewhere around 85–90 percentile at best — and even that would be quite tough. Alongside this, I’ve also been trying to start my own business. It’s still in a very early stage and not generating any revenue yet, but I do have a few potential customers lined up, so I think there’s some promise if I focus on it more seriously. Now, here’s the twist I had randomly applied to a company for a role just for fun, not expecting anything, but somehow I got selected. It’s actually a really good company one of those that looks great on your CV and could be an excellent stepping stone. The pay is decent too. They’ve asked me to join in the second week of December. So now I’m torn between three paths: 1. **Focus on CAT and MBA prep** \- but I’m not sure if my score will be competitive enough for a top B-school. 2. **Join the job** \- gain experience, strengthen my profile, and maybe continue preparing for CAT alongside work. 3. **Focus on my business -** try to grow it full-time, even though it’s risky and in an early phase. I’ve also been wanting to just take some time off and travel solo around India - something I’ve never done before. If I decide to join the job, I could use this month before December to finally do that. I’m really confused about what would be the best route to take. Should I focus on CAT, work on my business, or take up this job and gain experience first? Would really appreciate some honest advice or perspectives from people who’ve been in a similar situation.",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1oj2iur/need_help_to_choose_between_cat_vs_startup_vs_job/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1oj0l31,2025-10-29T10:11:02,india,Avoid TCL India - Worst Service Experience Ever.,"I’m posting this so others don’t end up in the same nightmare. I bought one of TCL’s most expensive TVs in India, expecting decent customer service. Instead, I’ve faced a complete disaster. My TCL 75C755 QD-Mini LED TV (purchased October 2024, still under warranty) frequently blacks out and flickers, especially during fast-moving scenes. Watching sports or even normal content is nearly impossible. Here’s what happened with service: First visit: Technician came once, tinkered with the unit, promised to return, but never did. Later, TCL falsely marked the case as “customer unavailable.” Second visit: Another technician refused to come because only my wife and family were home. His exact words: “I’ll only visit when you’re there, not when ladies are at home.” Since then: No follow-up, no callback, no resolution. Weeks have passed. TCL India’s customer support is a joke. They clearly don’t care once the sale is done. For a company selling “premium” TVs (my model costs ₹ 1.5 lakhs), this level of service is unacceptable. If you value your time, money, and sanity, stay far away from TCL India.

After completing my MBA in Marketing, I’ve worked across three roles in media and advertising sales — primarily handling brand partnerships, event sponsorships, and advertising solutions for both print and digital platforms. My work has always been a blend of sales, client servicing, and event execution. I’ve collaborated with marketing teams to conceptualize campaigns, negotiated deals, managed relationships with clients and agencies, and also helped execute branded events end-to-end. Over the years, I’ve realized that while I’ve learnt a lot — from understanding client needs to managing tight timelines — I’m now at a point where I’d like to pivot into a different field. The Indian sales ecosystem can be extremely tough and high-pressure, with constant targets and little breathing space, even when the market itself is price-sensitive and unpredictable. It’s reached a point where I feel my energy and creativity are getting drained, and I’d really like to find a more balanced and sustainable role. I’m exploring areas like Customer Success, Client Servicing, Event Marketing, or Event Operations — roles that still involve relationship-building and strategic thinking, but without the relentless sales pressure. If anyone here has made a similar switch, I’d love to hear how you did it — or if you think there are other career paths that could be a natural fit for my background, I’m open to ideas.

I officially remitted funds (Western union and sometimes via friends/family), so I can prove the money came from me — but the property and paperwork were registered under my mother’s name because I wasn’t physically present to sign things. Now, things are a mess: * I’ve spent roughly **₹28–29 lakhs** (and in total nearly **₹50 lakhs** toward the house/building/furnishing), yet the house is **unfinished inside** — no proper interiors, no furniture — and my mother lives with only basic things. * There’s **3–4 lakhs of unpaid loans/credit-card debt** in my mother’s name and **18+ credit enquiries** on her CIBIL. She doesn’t read English and was manipulated into signing approvals. * My **sister (24)** and **brother-in-law (29)** appear to have used a lot of the money for personal expenses. Brother-in-law is uneducated, unemployed (depends on his father’s farm income) and spends a lot of time on games. I’ve noticed multiple transfers from my mother’s account for things like servicing my brother-in-law’s family car, paying his household bills, and buying things for his house. Every time I sent money for my mother’s needs, she forwarded it to him. It’s painful to realize that everything I sent for her living expenses was being used by him for his own family. He has no self-respect — he can’t afford anything himself for my sister and their child, so I’ve been unintentionally covering his entire family’s financial needs without my consent. What hurts more is that my mother has been completely manipulated into thinking they are the only ones who care about her. Because she believes I may never return to India to live with her, she prioritizes my sister and her husband over everything else. To them, I’ve become nothing more than an ATM — just a source of money. I also found out that my sister and her husband use my mother’s Google Pay and PhonePe for most transactions. My brother-in-law isn’t financially stable, but instead of trying to work or improve, he’s been stealing from me indirectly by exploiting my mother’s trust and dependence. * My mother is afraid to confront them or file an FIR because she thinks it will “ruin” my sister’s marriage and bring shame in the village. She’s protecting them and refuses to share full bank/credit statements with me. Mediators and relatives are mostly siding with them. * My sister is unwell (recently diagnosed with cancer). Brother-in-law has even said he might leave her once the child grows up. Yet they won’t clear anything up. I haven’t been to India recently and I’m struggling to manage this remotely. I want to **protect my mother and the property** and to **hold my sister and brother-in-law accountable**, but I can’t be there in person.

1oigid0,2025-10-28T17:58:10,india,Unity in diversity but only for the rich - a telling attitude of Indians in India and abroad.,"Chath Pooja, a festival of people in Bihar is being celebrated in full swing in most of the states where Biharis form a significant population. There are massive arrangements made from the government in Maharashtra, Haryana and even Bengal for that matter to make it a community celebration. Apparently this has irked a lot of people, who are complaining that this shouldn't take place in their states. Many are blaming Bihari people for not disposing the pooja items properly. Some are complaining about Biharis playing loud music. Many are irked by the fireworks which were totally fine till it was Diwali. This isnt unique criticism to Bihar - you may take any poor, marginalised group in India, they're severely hated and everyone has a say in how they should celebrate their festivals. Many come forward to preach forgetting how their own festivals are not much different. Muslims , another marginalised group, bearing similar discrimination and hate for their festivals. Many Muslims are criticised severely for using djs while celebrating or even a small incident of their public celebration becomes a topic of concern for others. No one wants to live with Muslims in India - But same Indian diaspora is okay living with Arab Muslims in countries like Dubai, Oman. No one preaches kr bats and eye over there. In Mumbai, Marathis have been pushed to marginalisation - and suddenly there's a rise in hatred against Marathi festivals like Ganapati festival. Many took to social media to preach on how Marathis should celebrate Ganesh chaturthi quietly in their houses, without Djs or public processions. But ironically among the many communities which discriminate people based on their dietary preferences, deny housing to other communities in their area and have created their lobbies in business , are never called out for their discrmination. Their festivals aren't a ground to preach civic sense nor they're asked to tone it down - There was an impromptu celebration of Garba in Mumbai airport recently - people who preach about other festivals were seen praising the idea of mixing culture with airport. No outrage over there, because the people aren't poor or marginalised. We as a society, have become so unemphatic that we have started discriminating in criticism as well.",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1oigid0/unity_in_diversity_but_only_for_the_rich_a/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

Despite being labelled as ""extra-departmental"" employees, we are the ones doing the *most critical groundwork*, especially in the *remotest parts of India* where senior officials like Inspectors or Senior Post Master may never even step foot. Yet, we're constantly under *immense pressure* from Inspectors and Overseers. We are assigned *illogical and unrealistic targets*, such as: - Opening a fixed number of *new POSB accounts* - *Booking articles (speed post/ registered post) regardless of whether customers show up or not - Forcing services upon poor villagers and we are asked not to withdraw money to customers if they aren't willing to open new savings account. How is that even reasonable.. one posb account requires deposit of 500rs.it might not be much to others but for these people these small amount brings food for a week or two. Plus every other day there is pressure of our salary getting hold if we don't achieve targets. Now even from IPPB branch we gets pressure for achieving targets. We’re not wven given the same benefits as the other employees in Indiapost because we’re not permanent staff, yet most of the department’s daily public-facing work depends on us*. We deliver services and trust to people in far-flung areas, something that’s critical to the department’s functioning. Another thing on paper our work time is 4 hrs only but in real it pretty much a full time job. Now I know many might say since u get paid around 16k it's a lot than many people yeah maybe but the thing is I need to pay rent of my own room since I'm far from home for job plus the office rent and there are other expenses like transport so by the end of month I have almost nothing left in hand there is no savings just I'm surviving 😔 We deserve *better recognition, fairer expectations, and support instead of pressure*. It’s disheartening to be treated like we're easily replaceable when we're actually holding up the system in rural India. Irony is even if we apply for resignation they will never let us go easily, why? Because many get selected for these posts but once they visit the areas they got appointed they never join after seeing such remote places where even basic facilities are nil. Also,after u join u get to know that the government is not paying u any penny for the office maintenance every little thing including from the rent to the copies for office records all u have to pay from the peanuts like salary they are paying u.

1oi7q76,2025-10-28T12:15:32,india,The proliferation of the Iphone: A different perspective,"So often times, I have seen criticism levied, especially at todays generation, for having an incesssant and unjustifiable hype towards the flagship Apple gadget. Most tech influencers decry the IPhone as nothing special in terms of performance for the price, and many say, justifiably so, that for the same specs you could get a much cheaper Android. I do not disagree with any of them, but I have an alternate perspective. Being a Gen Z myself, I have realised that the I-phone is NOT just a phone. It is a status symbol. A marker, which commands repute and prestige. And lets be honest, we all judge each other. Especially in India. When we meet someone, we try to look for subtle cues or tendencies to determine how much ""comfortable"" the other person is, and then subconsciously we let that dictate how much respect to provide to that person. Back in the old days? People, especially women, used to do this by wearing heavy jewellery of gold and diamonds. Men also wore chains and rings. Yes, they were more prudent, as the metal itself was an investment. But the exorbitant making charges that jewellers charge, often make them quite expensive status markers aswell. In todays world, people no longer tend to wear so much jewellery. Instead, they look for more subtle and ""non-tacky"" ways. Branded shoes. Branded clothes. Expensive vacations. And of course, the expensive-est of all phones, the I-PHONE! When you're getting to use the same phone as the Ambanis, and someone notices that, it is bound to increase your 'perceived' value. Such is the superficiality of the world we live in. Where necessities like phones are first commoditised, to make everyone addicted, and then premiumised aswell, to make people 'ASPIRE' for the latest flagship phones. Its kinda not ideal, and definitely not sustainable. And I dont agree with this principle. But I do understand it, and I feel that nuance and reasoning is missing from most online discourses.

Within hours, you’ll see the same words floating all over Twitter, WhatsApp, and god knows where else: *“Masterstroke,” “Bold decision,” “Historic move.”* It’s like they’ve automated praise. Doesn’t even matter what the move *is.* One fine day, you wake up and the 500 and 1000 rupee notes are just fancy wallpaper now? “Masterstroke.” Nation goes into lockdown overnight, millions stranded without food or transport? “Masterstroke.” Article 370 revoked without proper planning? “Bold move.” Gas prices through the roof? “Sacrifice for the nation.” Next week if the sky falls, someone will tweet “Don’t worry guys, it’s part of a 4D chess plan.” What’s crazy is how they’ve managed to turn rashness into a kind of national aesthetic. It’s like if it’s sudden, disruptive, and hurts a lot of people, it *must* be visionary. The more panic it causes, the more “strategic” it apparently is.We’ve reached a point where thoughtfulness is seen as weakness, and chaos looks like leadership. People genuinely equate good governance with shock value now. “At least he did something,” they say... as if doing *anything* is automatically better than thinking before doing. Meanwhile, every actual economist, policy expert, and half-decent bureaucrat is sitting there like bro, maybe think before you nuke the currency? But no, that’s “anti-national.”And the IT cell is like that friend who always justifies their bad decisions. “Yeah, I crashed the car... but it was to test the airbags.” It’s wild how every failure gets rebranded as “pain for long-term gain.” Like there’s always some invisible 10D plan that only true patriots can understand. Where is that gain though? Demonitisation wrecked small businesses, the lockdown destroyed migrant livelihoods, inflation’s a mess... and yet we’re still told “you just don’t get it.” Maybe that’s the trick: make failure look like foresight, and people stop asking questions. But here’s the truth... leadership isn’t about looking decisive. It’s about *being* responsible. Consultation, planning, data; these aren’t boring bureaucratic things. They’re literally what separate governance from gambling. India doesn’t need another surprise announcement at 8 p.m. It needs boring, careful, evidence-based decision-making. The kind that doesn’t need hashtags to justify itself. Because this “Masterstroke” obsession... it’s not patriotism. It’s political gaslighting with better branding.",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ohqgg0/the_masterstroke_syndrome/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1ohpspt,2025-10-27T20:36:53,india,The rise of hooliganism in Bhubaneswar that needs to be called out and dealt with strictly,"I will cite two serious incidents of hooliganism(apart from many such recurring incidents) that made me think Bhubaneswar is slowly turning into a hub of lawlessness. First incident: Back in the summer months, I used to leave early morning for running (run on the empty footpaths) I once witnessed a drunk idiot on a cycle following and abusing two women who probably were walking to their work. These women were avoiding that guy and were trying to walk away faster. I was coming running from their opposite direction. Day light was up and sun was about to rise. As I ran towards them When I realised and heard what was happening, I instantly intervened, and asked that guy quite sternly ""what happened.. why you abusing.. what's wrong.? I have a baritonish voice.. and decent lean physique with decent height.. so this drunk man got intimidated. Fuckall lowlifes like these are not used to intervention while doing such things. so when someone slightly bigger than them steps up they fucking run away and this happened here as well. ""No brother nothing"".. The guy sort of smiled, mumbled and slowly pedalled away..he was clearly so much drunk.. literally not able to balance that god damned cycle. I told the women to be careful and maybe call someone from their family or call police.. but they said they were okay.. and they walked away.. they were apparently going to a nearby bus stop to catch a bus for work..which was quite nearby.. I was not carrying my phone as I was in jogging attire and i prefer staying without gadgets while working out or running/walking. Otherwise, i would surely have called cops on that drunk fuck. Again, cops in this city are not at all helpful and I'm telling this from my experience. Now, on to the second incident. It happened A few hours ago last evening. I witnessed some young guys sneaking up near the wall of a house, throwing a loud cracker bomb right inside the house compund and then escaping. These hooligans waited for me and two kids on two cycles to cross them. While crossing them I found them suspiciously standing near the fence of the house and talking in low tone. I was on a call and didn't really thought why these guys stopped there scooter near the fence of the house which was sort of a dark area as the far away street light was not reachable there. I thought may be they are just talking or having a cigarette or something. I got well ahead of them when I heard a really loud bang. Then these 3 guys sat on the scooter and escaped while laughing joyfully. I was carrying some food and was on call with my sister so couldn't do much as they sped away. One cannot even give festival or religion as a shield of excuse to throw a loud bomb into someone's house compound. It's already a week since Diwali is already over. I'm sure this kind of activity falls under some kind of criminal offence if one looks in the law book. I grew up in Bhubaneswar and this city was never like the way it is now. This city is becoming full of criminals, ho...",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ohpspt/the_rise_of_hooliganism_in_bhubaneswar_that_needs/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

Go to almost any random street – broken roads, footpaths broken or just dirt/dust between the road and buildings, run down concrete structures with plastic/metal sheets hanging out, a little open drain here and there, garbage and dirt around. Yes, India is still a low to lower middle income country. But of late, many Indians have been going to similarly lower (middle) income countries in Asia and Africa and we have Google Street View everywhere. Countries like Vietnam have similar incomes as richer Indian states (15-20k USD by PPP). But the cleanliness, urban spaces, as well as aesthetic sense are leagues ahead of anywhere in India. Rwanda, a country much poorer than India, is becoming renowned for being extremely clean and safe. Now you might say that these countries have authoritarian regimes and laws. Singapore is another diverse Asian country that became one of the richest in the world through Draconian measures. So it seems democracy only works in homogeneous populations. Until you consider Mauritius. It's an island country where Indians, Chinese, Africans, and some Europeans were brought together and forced to mingle. Half the population is Hindu. It is now a high income country with advanced infrastructure and quality of life. And it's a democracy with a democracy index score above those of most European nations and the US. So low income or democracy in a diverse society is not what's stopping India from progressing. Mindset is the only explanation.

1ogoqxm,2025-10-26T16:19:26,india,Part 2 of Child marriage a dark reality of 2025 - deep insight of my community.,"In my last post, I got to know that people want to talk about child marriage.Here is the post - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/s/eLI0o4c5iC Now I will give you a deep insight into my community and how they are manipulating laws. They have created a way in which, instead of marrying at a younger age, they do engagements whenever they feel the right time has come. The age can be anywhere from 1 month to 10 years, and when they attain legal age, they perform the marriage ceremony. In between the time of engagement and the marriage ceremony, the families perform certain rituals. It starts from the day of engagement, when the girl’s family goes to the boy’s family and gives a small token amount, and vice versa (the girl and boy don’t meet). After that, in every big ceremony of common relatives, they give some gifts to the boy and girl. Then, a ceremony is performed in which some jewelry, clothes, toys, and other gifts are given to both sides. It means the boy and girl who are engaged are put into a bubble, a sense that they are already in an established relationship. They are given continuous stimulation through gifts from a very small age, which makes them feel happy and content with what is happening. Over this, emotional training by mothers, elder cousins, sisters, and relatives is given to strengthen the belief that it is all natural. Boys are taught that the life of a girl depends on their actions — if they earn well, she will be happy, and she will be affected by anything they do. Girls are taught to stay within limits, think only about their spouse, and learn to manage the home. The girls get education only if the boy’s side relatives allow it. In between all this, if any party (families, not children) feels they want to cancel the engagement, then they have to discuss it in meetings held by powerful men of the community. After that, they decide an amount of settlement which ranges between 1 lakh to 10 lakh or even more. After that, whenever the families feel it’s time to perform the marriage (not from the perspective of the boy and girl, whether they are ready or not, but from whether the families are financially ready or not), they go ahead with the ceremony. Sometimes it happens before the legal age, sometimes they wait until the legal age. Then, after the marriage is done, the wife can’t stay with her husband until another small ceremony is performed, in which the husband’s family goes to take the wife home. Some jewelry and gifts are also offered at that time. The time between the marriage and this ceremony can range from 6 months to several years, again depending on the decision of the families. This is happening in 2025. And bitter part is government is not updated to handle this, they only give reports and numbers that this much percentage of decline in child marriage in this much year, but the reality is far from truth. Court doesn't recognize engagement at early age as crime. It's all going on no one is talking about this.",2,,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ogoqxm/part_2_of_child_marriage_a_dark_reality_of_2025/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

(Regarding a laptop for college)","Hey everyone, I'm posting on r/india and r/dubai because I'm in a really difficult situation and I'm hoping a kind stranger might be able to help me out. I know this was a huge mistake on my part, and I was probably too trusting, but I'm a student and I felt like I had no other choice at the time. Here's what happened: I'm a student in India. I did some freelance work and was paid with an Amazon.ae (Dubai) gift card. I used that money to buy a laptop that I desperately need for my college. Since I couldn't ship it directly to India, I found a small-time content creator online who is also from India but lives in Dubai. He seemed trustworthy and agreed to receive the laptop and bring it with him on his next trip to India. The laptop was successfully delivered to his address in the **Al Karama** area of Dubai at the end of July. I have the delivery confirmation and he even confirmed he received it. For a while, everything seemed fine. Unfortunately, he has now cut off all communication. He's been ignoring my messages, and I'm starting to realize I've been scammed and he intends to keep my laptop. This laptop represents months of my hard work, and I genuinely can't afford to buy another one. My college requires it, and I'm feeling pretty helpless being all the way here in India. **This is where I need your help:** I'm looking for someone trustworthy who lives in or near **Al Karama, Dubai,** and is planning to travel to India (any major city is fine) in the coming weeks or months. The help I would need is to simply collect the laptop on my behalf. I have the person's full name, address, and phone number. For anyone who is genuinely willing to help, I can provide a folder with all the proof: * The full Amazon order and delivery confirmation. * Our entire chat history where he agrees to everything. * His full contact details. I know this is a massive ask from a stranger on the internet, but I'm at my wit's end. Any advice, leads, or direct help would mean the world to me right now. Thank you for taking the time to read this. **TL;DR: I'm a student in India who got scammed. A person in Al Karama, Dubai, has my college laptop that I paid for and is refusing to give it back or communicate.

My focus is on sharing workouts, routines, and exercises that have helped me personally, with the goal of inspiring athletes and anyone looking to improve their performance through sports or fitness. Right now my community looks like this: * **Personal Instagram**: 800+ followers * **Fitness-focused Instagram**: \~100 followers * **TikTok**: \~200 followers It’s still small, but it’s engaged — people in both of my Instagram accounts and TikTok follow closely whenever I post. One strength I have is that any collaboration or promotion can be shared across all three accounts simultaneously, giving it wider reach while staying authentic to my community. What I’m looking for is to connect with brands (sportswear, gym gear, running shoes, supplements, or drinks) or even individual creators who are open to collaboration. I want to grow together, while providing real value to my audience. **Collaboration terms**: I’m open to flexibility: this could mean either a paid arrangement or a fair product exchange, depending on what works best for both sides.

1oickt5,2025-10-28T15:33:15,forhire,[FOR HIRE] Senior Full-Stack Python & React Developer for End-to-End Product Development,"Hi Reddit, Are you a founder with a great idea but need a technical partner to build it? Or a business bogged down by manual processes and spreadsheets? I'm a senior full-stack developer and for the last 7+ years, I've specialized in taking ideas from concept to a fully-realized, production-ready application. I don't just write code; I build entire products and solve business problems. --- ## **What I Can Do For You** My goal is to be your end-to-end technical partner. I handle everything so you can focus on your business. * **Build Your MVP from Scratch:** Have an idea for a SaaS product? I'll work with you to define the core features, architect the system, and build a robust Minimum Viable Product to get you to market. * **Automate Your Business Processes:** Still running your business on a collection of chaotic spreadsheets? I'll build you a custom web application to streamline your operations, reduce errors, and give you a single source of truth. * **Maintain or Modernize Your Existing App:** Need a reliable developer to fix bugs, add new features, or modernize the tech stack of your existing Python/JavaScript application? I can jump in and take ownership. * **Full DevOps & Deployment:** I don't just build the app; I get it running reliably. I handle server provisioning (AWS, VPS), containerization with Docker, and automated deployments. --- ## **My Technology Stack** I am a pragmatist and choose the right tools for the job. My core expertise includes: * **Backend:** Python (Django, FastAPI) * **Frontend:** React & TypeScript (for complex UIs) or HTMX & AlpineJS (for fast, lightweight solutions) * **Databases:** PostgreSQL, DynamoDB * **Infrastructure & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, Ansible, Linux --- ## **Proof of Work & Experience** Actions speak louder than words. Here’s a look at what I build: **Case Study: Automating International Trade Compliance** A client needed to replace a slow, error-prone manual process that lived in spreadsheets. I architected and single-handedly built a full-stack application from scratch. * **The Problem:** Hours of manual data entry and cross-referencing to check product compliance with complex USMCA trade rules. * **My Solution:** A web app with a Python/AWS backend and a React front-end that automated the entire process. * **The Result:** A task that took hours of manual work can now be completed in **under a minute** with zero errors. **Personal SaaS Project** I built my own time-tracking and invoicing SaaS from the ground up to solve my own business needs. This demonstrates my ability to own a product entirely, from data modeling in Django to a polished UI with HTMX. --- ## **Let's Talk** I'm currently open for new freelance projects. If you're looking for a reliable, senior-level developer to take full ownership of your product, I'd love to chat. * **Reddit:** Feel free to send me a DM or chat request here. * **Email:** Visit my website to see my email address or ask in DM. * **Website:** https://joshkaramuth.co...",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1oickt5/for_hire_senior_fullstack_python_react_developer/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

The (self-proclaimed) CEO of erotica is back once more, offering to bring your craziest fantasies into reality! Now with a psychology degree to boot ! I've graduated university and now am twice more prepared to make you come. To not waste any of your precious reading time, I’ll get right into it: I'm currently looking mostly to fill roleplaying hours and shorter commission slots. I'm running a sale with rates of $0.04w for text and $25/hr of roleplay for regular work, and starting at $0.06w/$30/hr for more extreme fetish content. Rescinding the rights to the works I’ve provided (which means you are free to use them in for-profit projects and belong to you), starts at $0.08w. * Regarding my experience, I’ve worked in: 3 erotic indie games (two of which I signed NDAs for, so I cannot provide much information, but the other project I can freely speak about, and I’m sure my employer would be open to recommending my services!) Three audio erotica companies (once again two under NDAs, the last one I can show the scripts and details for!). The content was mostly based around High-fantasy/D&D {Forgotten Realms} inspired) writing, but I also have experience with writing “sister’s friend falls in love with you” or “emo girl wants you” type content. I’ve written dozens of personal commissions, from short 2K stories up to a 15K novellete. * Some of my work has been focused in extreme kink (CBT, Guro, Slave, Hucow, Gigantism, Vore, Rape/Abuse, CNC, Extreme BDSM, Raceplay, etc), and I also have experience with Cuckolding and Hotwife content. * I wrote and edited a kink content novellete that was themed around high-concept, extreme BDSM, free-use, CNC and Harem content. I have ample experience in erotic worldbuilding (yes, you can have that and it’s very fun). Over the years I’ve developed an extensive erotic roleplaying career with dozens of partners, and currently have several regulars. * My personal mascot, Quinn the Velvet, specializes in Femdom, humiliation, teasing and escort-services. * I have gained a lot of experience in Cuckold and topping in general, both as Male and Female characters, with several regulars that can testify to my prowess. * I have a either: natural ease at achieving new and niche kinks and enjoy exploring the unknown; or a fascinating obsession to figure it out exactly, making sure to please you with either option all the same. Here's my portfolio in case you want to take a quick look at some of my work!: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iTJS-47GagzDNQuSip18Kba0zzVISl0n?usp=drive\_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iTJS-47GagzDNQuSip18Kba0zzVISl0n?usp=drive_link) If after all this you're not convinced then I ask you...

1okggam,2025-10-31T00:27:33,webdev,"LLMs and AI tools give you _exactly_ what you ask for, and to me that's a big problem.","I recently had to add a feature to an app I am working on. I just installed Cursor 2.0 and was curious about some of their new features, and try out the new ""Agent"" mode. Normally I don't really want to do the ""chat programming"", but I also like trying new workflows and just new techniques in general, so why not. I wrote out the feature I wanted and how I saw it coming together, and initiated the process with Claude. It worked quickly and completed my request exactly to my specifications...and then I realized that was the worst thing it could have done. The code was fine enough and it actually worked the way I originally intended to, but when I finally saw it in action and the impacts it would have down the line in the code structure and across the database, I realized that this request was kind of...stupid. I imagine if I was delegating this request to a human, that might have stopped and said ""Ummm, why are you doing it this way?"" and perhaps brainstormed with me a bit, or at least suggested an alternative and simpler way of approaching it. In fact, I think if I was just coding it without any assistance at all, I likely would have stopped 1/3 of the way in and realized how overly complicated I was making it! In hindsight, I realized I didn't really think it through fully, I was just really eager to get the feature implemented. The LLM, because its an algorithm, gave me what I **wanted**, but not what I **needed**, which can often be worlds apart. Which got me thinking about the impact on our work, the software, and the industry at large. If someone isn't really used to delegating tasks or questioning their own approach, which comes from years of experience (and messing up), then they might just proceed with the request and the provided solution, but come to regret it later (or some future dev will regret it). So many major breakdowns in software and coding often stem from subtle, nuanced and seemingly innocuous bugs that were introduced through micro-decisions, buried layers deep, and often don't reveal themselves until they are uncovered through a converging of vectors and circumstances at a later point in time. And then it's this mystery that requires panicked sleuthing to uncover the root cause. And yes, this happened well before LLMs, but do we really want to INCREASE those incident rates? I get the feeling that once the LLM craze calms down and the dust continues to settle, we're going to see a resurgence in the fundamentals, especially as we delegate more to the unconscious algorithms that are designed to meet the request, instead of question the intent.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1okggam/llms_and_ai_tools_give_you_exactly_what_you_ask/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1okf5d1,2025-10-30T23:29:49,webdev,GitHub Copilot custom Agents - first impressions,"At GitHub Universe they announced custom Agents. https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-custom-agents I've made three agents so far. 1. Scaffolding a project, 2. Design, 3. Design Debugging Here are my height level notes of how I'm thinking about it. Custom Agents gives the AI model constaints, context, and capabilities. ✨ Constaints - you can choose which tools the model can use. For example if you want it to only plan, you can take away the ""edit"" tool, and tell the model ""do not change files"" in the instructions. I made a debug agent and took away ""edit"". When I ran Claude, it did the debugging and then wrote in it's thinking ""hey, I can't change the code! Where is the edit tool?"" 😅 ✨ Context - you can tell the AI model what it needs to know for a task without 1. Repeating yourself in the prompt, or 2. Cluttering up your custom instructions. I plan to go back to old projects and make my custom instructions file a lot smaller by moving it to agent files AI models get confused with too many instructions and too many irrelevant instructions. ✨ Capabilities - this is the opposite of constaints. You can give you model access to MCP servers and other tools that you don't want your general AI model to have. You can also allow the agent to kick off work with another agent using ""handoffs"". I chained together three agents, but I can see myself getting more granular and improving each agent over time.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1okf5d1/github_copilot_custom_agents_first_impressions/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1okels5,2025-10-30T23:06:33,webdev,I built a math library for WYSIWYG editors that never touches transforms,"I spent the last few months solving a weird problem: **When you drag a corner to resize an element in a graphic editor, what should actually change?** Most editors modify the transform matrix (add a scale, translate the geometry). But in some cases, those transform values aren't just visual properties – they're semantic data. A 45° rotation might be keyframed. A position might be an expression like`text1.bottom + 20`. When you resize visually, you want to manipulate not any scale or translate but the ""real"" value of the element. # The problem with the ""easy"" approach Most editors just slap a scale transform or translation on the group when you resize it. Works for rendering, but terrible for expression-based systems or even if you like to keep a border-radius or a stroke as it is. If you later want to make something dynamic, your information is now split between child dimensions and group scale. Which one becomes expression-based? I needed the opposite: **Keep transforms untouched, only update x, y, width, height.** That's what bbox-skeleton does. It's purely a math library – no rendering, no dependencies except `transformation-matrix`. You give it element/group data and a new ""skeleton"" (where the corners should be) and it calculates what geometry changes are needed. Then you apply those to whatever engine you're using. **Demo:** [https://bbox-skeleton-demo.pages.dev/](https://bbox-skeleton-demo.pages.dev/) You can also manually set a group's or element's transform origin wo any absolute or relative point and it will calculate the changes on the geometry to all underlying elements. # How it works Elements have ""skeletons"" (4 corner points). When you manipulate in world space: 1. New skeleton defines where corners should be 2. Library figures out geometry changes needed 3. All transforms stay completely untouched Works recursively through groups. Resize a group, all children resize proportionally while keeping their rotations/scales/skews. **Good to know:** You can't resize groups with non-uniform scaling if they contain rotated/skewed elements (unless rotations are axis-aligned at 0°/90°/180°/270°). It's just mathematically impossible. Imagine an 45° rotated rectangle if you ""compress"" it from the bottom corner up, you would change the angles and so so the skew (rotate ist just a variant of skew). So, best practice is to lock aspect ratio when resizing groups or at least when they contain at least one element with a rotate() or skew() transformation that is not axis-align. # Why I built this I work on Bluepic (expression-based design engine). Users intend to set their element's properties with expressions that are sometimes just referring to variables or, non some cases, are more complex. WYSIWYG edits can't break those expressions by adding transforms. Geometry values need to be the source of truth, not hidden behind scale/translate properties. Couldn't find any library that did this – everything assumes you want to modify transforms.

It always targets my main notes page `/blog/notes`, with no query parameters and never visits any other pages. Only the localized version of the same page (`/{locale}/blog/notes`). When I publish a new note this bot visits it and then happens never again for the same note. This is strange for me because my blog is not popular yet. Each time this bot uses a new IP address located either in Singapore or China, with a wide IP range. For the past three months, it has been hitting the same page every hour, and sometimes even every minute. The IPs are different, but the operating system, browser, and screen dimensions are always the same. Here are some questions I would like to discuss: * What is the best way to handle this kind of bot? I could block entire countries in my analytics, but maybe it is better to deny requests at the proxy level for the specific user agent (browser + OS + screen)? * What is this bot trying to achieve? My only guess is that it is checking for fresh content to scrape as soon as it appears. Otherwise, why crawl so frequently? * Has anyone who runs a blog had a similar issue? * Can it hurt the SEO performance of the website? For example it steals the content 10 minutes after I publish the note and then this bot publish it somewhere else. Will search engines know that I’m the original author or not? Do I understand this correctly? If it were a normal crawler from an AI company or a search engine, they would not be using more than **10,000 different IPs from the same country, right**? https://preview.redd.it/n4wicd12q8yf1.png?width=2464&format=png&auto=webp&s=52572b766b1d97808ab37af82c37f5c4eea53a1e https://preview.redd.it/l4uuuzq2q8yf1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=8623c42ff1d67feda07fbf02a032118e675b9ccb",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ojy1q3/botnet_is_stealing_the_content_why/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1ojvqdg,2025-10-30T10:10:37,webdev,"How do I best ensure separation of data between customers in the ""best"" way?","Hey! I would like to hear your guys opinions on how to ensure separation of data between organisations within an application I am developing. The web app is a fairly straight forward CRUD app with some file storage, that helps organisations deal with a certain kind of work flow. Note that users are always assigned to one and only one organisation and user roles are not yet relevant. The app is developed with the T3 stack, with Clerk as the authentication, Drizzle for ORM, tRPC for api calls and finally a postgresql database hosted at Neon. I am currently using what I believe to be called API-level security. I.e I use organisation Ids from Clerk to query for data in the tRPC router procedure. Here is an example: export const levelRouter = createTRPCRouter({ getAll: organizationProcedure.query(({ ctx }) => { return ctx.db.select().from(level).where(eq(level.organizationId, ctx.organizationId)); }), Where *organizationProcedure* uses a middleware to passes the organization Id via the context. **My problem**: I need to make sure that data can not leak between organisations. The current approach ""works"" in the sense that organisation Ids are properly retrieved server side and passed along with the tRPC context. And as long as I continue to maintain this approach everything seems fine. However, I am only a poorly written API call away from accidentally revealing data between customers by forgetting to include the `.where(eq(level.organizationId,ctx.organizationId))` . **What I have looked in to**: This issue has been bothering me for a while and I have spent quite some time browsing forums, reading documentation and torturing LLMs for a solution. After which I have been left with a few contenders, but no immediate ""perfect"" approach. I hope some of you might be interested in sharing your perspectives/experience on it. Here are the approaches I have seen so far. **Using Row Level Security (RLS):** The seemingly obvious first approach would be to use RLS to ensure that, even if I forget to filter for organizationIds, the data can not leave the database without proper authorisation. I thought this approach sounded wonderful and I tried to make it work with my current set up. Excuse my lack of web development / networking knowledge here, but it seems that it might be dangerous and difficult to maintain the database session variables for organisation Ids on the account of me using a pooling connection. As I understand it, we would have to set a session variable in the database that is then used by the RLS to match against entries. But since I am using a pooling connection, several organisations might share a connection which makes this approach even dicier than the API-level approach. **Creating a wrapper for API calls that inherently force the .where() clause on OrgIds:** Another possibility could be to write some sort of wrapper for the query methods that guarantees the use of the .where() on OrgIds. This approach seems ""fine"" in the sense that it reduces...",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ojvqdg/how_do_i_best_ensure_separation_of_data_between/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1ojnm5d,2025-10-30T02:05:20,webdev,Local first - The future of web development! How many of you disagree?,"I spent 250 hours building a blazing fast web based application with no loaders, realtime syncing called docufy ([fully opensource](https://github.com/chandeldivyam/docufy)). And no, the answer is not CONVEX! I have been building apps for my full time job with around 100k RPM (not huge, but is significant for learnings), but they are using traditional methods: having a server (node / fastapi), a frontend (react) and some way do to async tasks using redis. My goal was to learn. I wanted to find the hard parts of building a real app and the best ways to do it. The UX is inspired a lot by [Linear](https://linear.app/). Before I started, I set three rules: 1. 🏎 Everything has to be ***blazing fast***! 2. 🔄 ***Real-time syncing*** (the page updates by itself when something changes) 3. Actually ***provide value*** and not a dummy todo project (if someone wants they can replace a paid application) - in our case it would be gitbook / mintlify What went inside it? So many micro decisions now that I look back. Here is a breakdown of all the technical pieces (we will discuss each of the decision and why it was taken later) # Database * Postgres 🏆 * Convex DB * Mongo I started with convex but due to some limitations (discussed later), moved to postgres. # Frontend Framework * React + Vite * Nextjs * Tanstack start 🏆 These three option felt most logical to me (I am not a huge frontend guy and hence didn't explore svelte, nuxt, vue etc. These three seem the most viable options which I understood well enough to keep the momentum. I started with nextjs + convex and later moved to Tanstack start. But I did choose nextjs for the renderer. Also, using inngest for event based actions. # Auth * workos * better auth 🏆 * clerk # Sync Engine * [convex db](https://www.convex.dev/) * [electric-sql](https://electric-sql.com/) 🏆 * [rocicorp zero](https://zero.rocicorp.dev/) * [instant db](https://www.instantdb.com/) Now, this was a hard decision. I choose convex initially, felt some limitations and moved to electric-sql. Convex is not local first (even if I do optimistic updated, but navigation with nextjs was not butter smooth and didn't load instantly). # Infra * vercel 🏆 * cloudflare * aws + sst 🏆 I choose vercel for the renderer (the end customer facing docs so that everything is on edge and blazing fast loads across the globe) while the webapp which is used for creation is on aws. The reason is the sync engine, electric uses long polling using serverless didn't feel like a good idea for that. # Search * elasticsearch * meilisearch * typesense 🏆 # Step by step process for development Step 1: Decide on what are the things that you deeply care about and their tradeoffs, I was extremely concerned about the experience of the user and hence had to build it twice.

1ojni2o,2025-10-30T02:00:10,webdev,A reminder that there are more react hooks than useState and useEffect!,"Please don't roast me for wanting to share this, but I've been learning more about newer react hooks and remembered when I knew no other hooks than `useState` and `useEffect` lol. I am not here to judge, I am here to help spread the knowledge with a few hooks I have became way more familiar and comfortable with! Here is a reminder for all the hooks you don't use but probably should! # useMemo: The ""I already did it"" hook `useMemo` helps prevent unnecessary re-computation of values between renders. It’s perfect for expensive functions or large array operations that depend on stable inputs. ``` const filteredData = useMemo(() => { return thousandsOfDataPoints.filter((item) => item.isImportant && item.isMassive); }, [thousandsOfDataPoints]); ``` Without `useMemo`, React would re-run this filtering logic **every render**, even when `thousandsOfDataPoints` hasn’t changed. With it, React only recalculates when `thousandsOfDataPoints` changes — saving you cycles and keeping components snappy. The takes away, use useMemo for large datasets that don't really change often. Think retrieving a list of data for processing. # useCallback: The ""Don't do it unless I tell you"" to hook `useCallback` prevents unnecessary re-renders caused by unstable function references. This becomes essential when passing callbacks down to memorized child components. ``` import React, { useState, useCallback, memo } from ""react""; const TodoItem = memo(({ todo, onToggle }) => { console.log(""Rendered:"", todo.text); return ( <li> <label> <input type=""checkbox"" checked={todo.completed} onChange={() => onToggle(todo.id)} /> {todo.text} </label> </li> ); }); export default function TodoList() { const [todos, setTodos] = useState([ { id: 1, text: ""Write blog post"", completed: false }, { id: 2, text: ""Refactor components"", completed: false }, ]); // useCallback keeps 'onToggle' stable between renders const handleToggle = useCallback((id: number) => { setTodos((prev) => prev.map((t) => t.id === id ? { ...t, completed: !t.completed } : t ) ); }, []); return ( <ul> {todos.map((todo) => ( <TodoItem key={todo.id} todo={todo} onToggle={handleToggle} /> ))} </ul> ); } ``` Every render without `useCallback` creates a **new function reference**, triggering unnecessary updates in children wrapped with `React.memo`. By stabilizing the reference, you keep your component tree efficient and predictable. ### Why This Is Better * Without useCallback, handleToggle is recreated on every render. * That means every TodoItem (even unchanged ones) would re-render unnecessarily, because their onToggle prop changed identity. * With useCallback, the function reference is stable, and React.memo can correctly skip re-renders. In large lists or UIs with lots of child components, this has a huge performance impact. The take away, useCallback in child components. Noticeable when their parents are `React.memo` components. This could 10x UIs that rely on heavy nesting. # useRef: The ""Don't touch my SH!T"" hook `useRef` i...",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ojni2o/a_reminder_that_there_are_more_react_hooks_than/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

I’m new to UI/UX, and while I don’t plan to make it my career, I’ve completely fallen in love with this world and want to turn it into a hobby because I find it both relaxing and satisfying. I’ve never done development or worked in this field before, so almost everything is new to me. I’ve watched several tutorials, including some long, in-depth videos, but I don’t have anyone to ask questions to, which is why I’m reaching out. ------------------------------------ I’ve started working on a portfolio (random project to test and learn), but I’ve encountered a few challenges that I’m not sure how to approach. **1. Navbar** I understand there are countless ways to design a navbar, which is great. My question is: * What is the best practice for the distance between the navbar and the main content? Like, what makes you decide how much space to set? **2. Catchy Phrase / Hero Section** In the screen given, I have a possible catchy phrase with a short description of what X person do. On the right side, I have another section where I present the same idea in a slightly different way, which I personally like more. * Is this considered bad practice? * Should I move the right section to another page where I go into more detail about each of those? I’d like to keep it on the main page because the catchy phrase alone feels a bit generic or 'AI GENERATED' (i gave a quick check to developer portfolios and most of them looks the same...) **3. Space Management** I’m struggling with filling space on the page. Of course, padding and margins help keep everything organized, but below my section “The result… repetitive work,” there’s almost half a page empty. What’s the best approach to make use of that space without making the page feel cluttered? **4. Symmetry** In the right section, I have five cards (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) stacked vertically. They are aligned symmetrically with each other and also aligned with the navbar. this considered bad practice? Could too much symmetry make the design look “boring” or uninteresting?

Im not so sure this is a great idea.. I would rather write frontend in bit more traditional way, for exempel NextJS, Angular or Nuxt (Something built in JS). I want the frontend to be as thin as possible (separate designsystem for accessable, resposive style) with dedicated services (.NET,REST) which knows more about the business, while the outermost presentation knowing less..

1oj0szi,2025-10-29T10:24:04,webdev,"I know I’ll be down-voted for this, but I’m done with Laravel.","I’ve been using Laravel since version 3. I took a couple of years off from web dev, came back, and it still felt like home. But now? It feels like I’m being nudged out of a place I once loved. Here’s what’s been wearing me down: * **Paid products everywhere.** It feels like every new feature or “official” solution now comes with a price tag — $100+ for single-project licenses. The ecosystem used to feel open and empowering; now it’s starting to feel less like a developer ecosystem and more like a subscription trap. * **Laravel Reverb pricing.** The new managed WebSocket service (Laravel Reverb) on Laravel Cloud charges $5/month for 100 concurrent connections and 200K messages per day. To run something at real-world scale, you’re easily looking at $100–$200/month. It’s basically a WebSocket server — you could self-host one for a fraction of that. * Everything’s a component now. The logo is a component, the site text is a component. The starter kits abstract *everything* to the point where it’s hard to understand what’s happening under the hood. Someone on Reddit put it perfectly: “Too much magic going on to understand basic things"" * **Flux UI + Livewire pricing.** If you want the full “official” UI experience with Livewire + Flux UI, that’s another $149 for a single project. Not knocking the quality — it’s solid work — but the constant paywalling across the ecosystem feels relentless. * **The direction of the framework.** Laravel used to feel community-driven and developer-first. Now it’s increasingly commercial — multiple paid add-ons, managed services, and a growing sense of vendor lock-in. A Medium post titled *“The Commercialization of Laravel: A Risk to Its Future”* captures this shift really well. At this point, I still love PHP and appreciate Laravel’s elegance, but the ecosystem just doesn’t feel the same. I don’t want to juggle another paid product or subscription just to build something simple. So yeah — I’m out. Curious what others here think: is this just where frameworks are heading now, or is Laravel losing the plot?",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1oj0szi/i_know_ill_be_downvoted_for_this_but_im_done_with/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

It is completely raw Javascript through-and-through, in 3 separate interdependent projects: a lobby server, a game server, and a client. The client is in Electron, but no reason I can't port it to run in a browser eventually. Server runs in Node and uses Websockets for game netcode. No game engine, the only thing I use is PixiJS for rendering. Everything else I rolled myself. Because I like to write code. In Javascript. edit: Forgot to mention: I use React + CSS for most of the UI edit2: A lot of people focusing on the React bit. I used React so I did not have to write my own GUI framework, I would have to re-invent the wheel for something I did not want to do (menus and navigation). I wanted to focus on cool stuff, like the actual game / physics / netcode, eg fun problems to solve (I'll definitely get hate for that on a webdev subreddit :D) edit3: people called Chris Sawyer crazy for coding Rollercoaster Tycoon in assembly instead of C. Use what you want guys, I just like making cool shit with web technology. edit4: I wanted this to come up in discussion but no one wants to discuss the implementation 😅 a lot of the game is defined declaratively, using JSON files.

1oi5dbw,2025-10-28T10:07:53,webdev,How to test and replace any missing translations with i18next,"I recently found a really practical way to detect and fill missing translations when working with i18next and honestly, it saves a ton of time when you have dozens of JSON files to maintain. Step 1 — Test for missing translations You can now automatically check if you’re missing any keys in your localization files. It works with your CLI, CI/CD pipelines, or even your Jest/Vitest test suite. Example: npx intlayer test:i18next It scans your codebase, compares it to your JSON files, and outputs which keys are missing or unused. Super handy before deploying or merging a PR. Step 2 — Automatically fill missing translations You can choose your AI provider (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, or Mistral) and use your own API key to auto-fill missing entries. Only the missing strings get translated, your existing ones stay untouched. Example: npx intlayer translate:i18next --provider=chatgpt It will generate translations for missing keys in all your locales. Step 3 — Integrate in CI/CD You can plug it into your CI to make sure no new missing keys are introduced: npx intlayer test:i18next --ci If missing translations are found, it can fail the pipeline or just log warnings depending on your config. Bonus: Detect JSON changes via Git There’s even a (WIP) feature that detects which lines changed in your translation JSON using git diff, so it only re-translates what was modified. If you’re using Next.js Here’s a guide that explains how to set it up with next-i18next (based on i18next under the hood): 👉 https://intlayer.org/fr/blog/intlayer-with-next-i18next TL;DR Test missing translations automatically Auto-fill missing JSON entries using AI Integrate with CI/CDWorks with i18next",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1oi5dbw/how_to_test_and_replace_any_missing_translations/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

Asked it to find specific vendors across months of documents, generate a payroll report from 20+ timecards, and edit files in real-time.

So my current plan is trying something lightweight like UptimeRobot for 1-minute pings, an RUM tool to see actual page speed for customers, and Sentry (or similar) for frontend/backend errors so I get stack traces instead of vague “it failed” alerts. I’ve also started logging CDN/edge status and payment gateway health, so I’m not chasing ghosts when a third party is the culprit. Honestly, the biggest win so far wasn’t the fancy reports, and it was reducing the noise: one channel for real incidents, another for FYI performance dips. If anyone’s tried a mix that caught weird edge cases (third-party script slowdowns, flaky payment responses), I’d love to hear what combo worked for you.

I just never looks and feels 100% coherent. I know there are global styling settings in wordpress and elementor and I try using them as much as possible but I always end up eyeballing stuff. A few pixels here, some width %'s there, minus some margin here, plus some padding there etc. It all adds up and becomes a mess. It didn't help that for the majority of the time I didn't wireframe / prototype, I went straight into the visual drag & drop bs and spent hours and hours tweaking the different elementor fields and settings. Then I watched some courses and figured out that it would be better to make mockups in Figma and then build those out later on. Using auto layout in figma I actually managed to get some pretty consistent designs, but I never managed to build them out 1:1 in elementor and always just go back to tweaking pixels, width percentages etc. But what I don't really get is that Figma auto layout produces the flexbox css code, which is already the entire backbone of the page is styled. So why would I want to make these figma designs, to then repeat the same process in some other tool like elementor that also abstracts away the core design principles? I am not looking for a figma -> website plugin or some hack, but a development process that makes building stuff predictable and consistent. Preferably I don't want to lock myself into some type of saas service or website builder and the process also needs to be future proof.

1ohjsjs,2025-10-27T16:54:06,webdev,💻 I just built a medical appointment management backend with Node.js + PostgreSQL here’s what I learned after 6 months,"Hey everyone! Over the past few months, I’ve been working on a backend project for a medical appointment management platform. It’s built with Node.js (Express.js), Sequelize, and PostgreSQL. The idea was to let doctors manage their availability, let patients book appointments, and include features like geolocation and review ratings. Here are a few things I learned along the way: 1. Data modeling matters a lot. I underestimated how complex relationships can get - especially between doctors, patients, and availability slots. Sequelize made it easier, but I had to rethink my database design several times. 2. Handling availability logic is tricky. Letting doctors define multiple time slots per day, with a maximum number of patients per slot, was more challenging than I expected. I had to be careful about overlapping time ranges and expired slots. 3. Geolocation integration (OpenStreetMap/Nominatim) was fun to implement. It allows patients to find doctors near them based on address coordinates - it felt rewarding when it worked! 4. Deployment isn’t “one click.” I used Render for hosting, but environment variables, SSL, and CORS needed extra attention. 5. Writing clean APIs pays off. Using middleware like express-async-handler made error handling so much cleaner. I’m now planning to add features like reviews, profile updates, and maybe a Flutter app for mobile users. If anyone’s done something similar (booking systems, scheduling apps, etc.), I’d love to hear your tips or how you handled time-slot logic efficiently!",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ohjsjs/i_just_built_a_medical_appointment_management/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

But I’m not a web developer, and the following problem has got me stumped! Maybe someone else can help. I have a large application that automates (uh) Internet Explorer, via Windows COM, the IE object model, and (uh) 150,000 lines of VBScript (!), to download, process and display personal data from various websites. I wrote this application in about 2009 for IE9 on a 10” netbook running Windows 7 Starter Edition. That was a perfect platform for me to take when travelling. It all worked perfectly for many years, whether travelling, or at home. However, I haven’t used this application for some years, and now I’d like to rescucitate it, at least temporarily, if humanly possible, before I decide whether and how to rewrite or replace it. A lot of it still works correctly! But I’m currently stuck on the following problem. The Australian and New Zealand Bank (ANZ) has an online banking login page at: https://login.anz.com/internetbanking That page works fine in Chrome version 109.0.5414.120 on Windows 7 Starter Edition. Chrome briefly displays a spinning circle progress indicator, then the actual login fields. However, in IE9 version 9.0.46 (KB3124275) on that same version of Windows - or IE11 running in a Windows 7 Enterprise VM on that same version of Windows - IE doesn’t proceed beyond that spinning circle indicator. It never displays the login fields. This spinning circle indicator seems to completely befuddle IE. And the ANZ website displays that spinning circle before many pages, not just the login page. So my questions are: - Why does that spinner stop IE, but not Chrome? What is actually happening behind the scenes? - Is there any way to work around this in IE, ie. cause that spinner to dismiss and proceed, eg. by modifying the loaded page’s DOM at runtime? I haven’t provided a test page or JS fiddle etc., since the best and easiest way to replicate this problem is just to browse to the specified URL from a relevant browser. I might eventually have to change to WGET, or Selenium, or Open Banking, or rewrite everything in Javascript v77 for Edge v88 on Windows v99, or whatever. But at present I just want to rescucitate my 150,000 lines of existing code, at least temporarily, if humanly possible, before deciding how to proceed. That’s the focus of this question.

1ohbkhk,2025-10-27T11:12:04,webdev,I built a lightweight workflow engine to orchestrate complex logic with visual builders,"I'm excited to share a project I created to solve orchestrating long-running, multi-step asynchronous processes. Flowcraft is a lightweight, zero-dependency workflow engine for Javascript/TypeScript. Flowcraft lets you define any process as a graph of functions and then executes it reliably. A key design goal was to bridge the gap between backend logic and frontend UIs. Here’s what makes it particularly useful for web developers: * **Powers Visual Workflow Builders:** The entire workflow is a serializable `WorkflowBlueprint` (JSON) enabling you to define complex logic using UI builders like **xyflow (React Flow)**. You can build a drag-and-drop UI for your users to create their own logic, and Flowcraft can execute it on the backend. * **Unopinionated & Pluggable:** The core engine has zero dependencies. Everything is extensible. You can plug in your own logger (like Pino/Winston), a better serializer (like `superjson`), custom middleware for transactions or tracing, and your own expression evaluator (if letting users write their own code). It doesn't force a specific framework on you. * **Scales from Monolith to Microservices:** Start building with in-memory execution, and as your app grows, you can switch to a distributed model using official adapters for **BullMQ, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, Google Pub/Sub, etc.** Your core workflow logic remains exactly the same. * **Built-in Testing Utilities:** Writing tests for complex async flows can be tricky; Flowcraft comes with a bunch of utilities that give you visualizations, logging, and tracing. It's MIT licensed and I'm hoping it can be a useful tool for fellow web developers building sophisticated UIs and backends. I'd love to hear your feedback. * **Docs & Live Demos:** [`flowcraft.js.org`](http://flowcraft.js.org) * **GitHub:** [`github.com/gorango/flowcraft`](http://github.com/gorango/flowcraft)",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ohbkhk/i_built_a_lightweight_workflow_engine_to/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

I want to take arbitrary HTML and translate its visual elements into corresponding FabricJS primitives (Textbox, Rect, Circle, Image, etc.). My current approach: 1. Parse the HTML with DOMParser 2. Render it off-screen in a hidden container 3. Use getBoundingClientRect() and getComputedStyle() to extract positions and computed styles 4. Map each visual element to FabricJS objects based on what I extract The problem: It's not working reliably. Text positioning is inconsistent, shapes don't render correctly, and fonts (especially icon fonts) aren't being preserved properly. My questions: \- Is there an existing library or standard approach for this type of HTML → FabricJS conversion? \- Should I be using a different method entirely? \- Any recommendations for preserving layout and styling during this conversion? I know about html2canvas, but that rasterizes everything to a bitmap. I need discrete FabricJS objects that remain editable.

1ogrewy,2025-10-26T18:04:33,webdev,built an app that tracks the world’s top artists,"hey everyone, i’ve been working on a small project called **world's top artists:** it tracks the world’s top 500 artists, updated daily, with insights, real-time stats and discovery features. the data comes from both spotify and apple music, aggregated into one place. it includes a bunch of cool views: – a world map showing top cities for listeners – a constellation graph showing how artists are connected (based on related artists) – a “former 500” page that keeps track of artists who dropped out of the chart – artist and music discovery features based on daily trends right now the app pulls the top 500 from [**kworb.net**](http://kworb.net), but I also keep a separate file of around **15,000 potential artists** who could enter the top list. I chose this approach because for now it’s a **showcase / mvp**, and I didn’t want to do heavy scraping. if the app shows potential and people enjoy it, I plan to move it to a proper server and domain. I already have an algorithm that can fetch the top 500 directly from spotify without relying on other sources. the interesting part is that the whole thing is **fully client-side, so** no backend at all. all data is stored as static json files on github, and a script runs every 24h via github actions to rebuild and push the new data. it’s fast, lightweight, and surprisingly capable for something that’s just html, json and javascript. link: [https://music.eduardlupu.com](https://music.eduardlupu.com) i’d really love to hear any kind of feedback: things you’d add, improve, or explore.

1ogr73c,2025-10-26T17:56:00,webdev,Question about nested components and css classes: Layout → Paper → CardBase,"Hey everyone, I’ve been working on a small component hierarchy and wanted to get some opinions about whether my approach makes sense or if it’s a bit too much. This is my current components setup: * **Layout** → handles general structure and spacing (dimensions, margins and paddings) * **Paper** → adds elevation, radius, and border * **CardBase** → builds on top of Paper with additional styling (colors, background, borders, ...) **CardBase** uses **Paper** as root and **Paper** uses **Layout** as root component. Each consume the classes of the parent component and appends it to their own. When rendered, a single tag ends up having quite a few classes, like this: ds-layout ds-layout--padding-spacing-24 ds-layout--margin-spacing-8 ds-paper ds-paper--radius-8 ds-paper--shadow-100 ds-paper--with-border ds-card-base ds-card-base--border-width-2px ds-card-base--background-purple-300 ds-card-base--border-color-purple-400 Most of these classes are quite verbose because they’re part of a legacy design system, and unfortunately, I can’t use Tailwind in this project. I *can* use CSS variables via the `style` prop, but that doesn’t really reduce the number of rules or layers. So my question is, Is this normal? Is it okay to have multiple foundational components like `Layout` and `Paper` stacked together when building higher-level components like `CardBase`? I don’t really mind the number of clases (it’s clear and modular), but I’m curious how others handle similar setups, especially when you want to avoid re-implementing the same rules across multiple components. What do you guys think? Is this just part of the tradeoff with a layered design system, or is there a cleaner approach you’ve found?",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ogr73c/question_about_nested_components_and_css_classes/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

I recently got back into development after a 3–4 year break ( I was alreadyy a frontend dev for 3 years before the AI revolution). I managed to land a new frontend position but my skills were pretty rusty at first, and I was thrown straight into a huge legacy codebase (PHP, jQuery, Twig, all that fun stuff). To get up to speed, I started using AI tools like Codex and Claude to help scaffold features and fix bugs. It worked insanely well ... So I’d prompt, review, correct, and merge. I now spend way more time prompting, reading, and redirecting AI than actually typing code myself. It’s been about 3 months now, and I’m getting a lot of positive feedback from my boss and coworkers about the quality of my work. But part of me feels like I’m shooting myself in the foot. I can’t shake the fear that if they knew how much of my output relies on AI assistance, they’d see me as a fraud. To be fair, I do understand everything I commit, and I often have to make the AI redo things multiple times because I can spot logic errors or architectural issues. I’m not blindly copy-pasting. But still... I can’t help but feel like I’m “cheating.” Has anyone else gone through this?

1ogl7ar,2025-10-26T13:54:12,webdev,Web development is interesting and feels like a superpower,"Just for context, I'm coming in from Swift-land. I've been a Swift developer my entire career and have developed for both iOS and macOS. But recently, I'd decided to explore the world of web development (front-end, to be exact), and it's been very... interesting, to say the least. I'd say the biggest takeaway I have about web development — and this is coming from a total beginner, so my impression could be totally wrong — is that it's sort of like developing on a virtual machine, where the browser is the ""VM"" and the apps the browser gives you access to (i.e. websites) are the software installed on the VM. And this where I find things to be interesting. I don't know if this whole ""VM"" perspective is a common thing, but, for me, prior to diving into the web, I'd never seen web development from the perpsective of ""As long as someone has access to a browser (which virtually everyone does), you can develop something, knowing that it can go to *anyone*, regardless of their operating system."" There's *so much* power in this. I'm not here to compare native mobile/desktop development to web development. I'm just here to say that web dev is an interesting portal into another level of possibilities. Like, sure, the mobile experience on the web may not be as good as a native mobile app, but it's getting there. And sure, if you want access to your favorite web apps, it's sort of a two-step process of (1) launch the browser and then (2) travel to the URL of the web app in question. But, nowadays, you can download your favorite websites — I believe this is called ""PWA (progressive web app)"" — and launch them as if they were their own standalone applications, which is bonkers to me. I didn't know that this was a thing until I'd started playing around with web development. All in all, my takeaway is that the web is not as limited as I'd originally thought it were and that it has so much more potential to grow.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ogl7ar/web_development_is_interesting_and_feels_like_a/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1okmmn1,2025-10-31T05:44:48,Entrepreneur,Hard times in dropshipping,"I'm a dropshipping agent but I'm here to talk about my experience in the industry for the recent years. Back in 2021, we were just starting in this business and a lot of new clients would rise and group by group they come and go. We didn't think it was good enough but looking back, we could even call it booming ages. Now as years go by, clients are gradully just leaving us. There are, of course, some of them were our fault, nobody is perfect and we all grow and learn. For example, there are times especially in Q4 or during holiday that shipment would be delayed and usually 3-5 business days longer than the usual expected shipping times. But we didn't know that and we didn't notify our clients ahead of the time about this. So they get pissed, thinking that we failed their expectations and said 5-7 business days become 10-12 business days. This make sense and I can see why they are leaving, ever from that, I've always notify my collagues to make sure to tell the clients that during business times, shipment may be delayed and it is expected. This will be a little bit better than before, but when it still actually happens, clients still gets pissed. I guess dropshipping, at its root, isn't really suitable for the e-commerce environment now since Amazon, Temu and Tiktok all can make shipment happen in just 2-4 business days, if you are just slower, customer will complain to you, then the client will complain to us. Dropshipping has become not the way to go, at least in mind mind, even if we want to do dropshipping, it has to be 3PL dropshipping in local rather than from China. Anyways, there are also other reasons and we've met many clients like this, 2 of the big clients decided to produce their product in Europe rather than getting products from China. others think they want to try other paths, but really the most just quit because they couldn't do it for the dropshipping. Over the years, we've served over 400+ clients and now, we are at its lowest time to be honest. Maybe it's just us, but to be honest it's kind of sad. I run this company and I only have 4 staffs now compare to previously we have about dozens of staffs. I mean just for the dropshipping department, we have other department like our own e-commerce, import & export and so on. But it's sad seeing situation like this. We also don't know where to go at this point as dropshipping just seems in general, having a deducing market volume. Take this like a old man grumpy grunning. How do I get out of this?

1okjw86,2025-10-31T03:11:59,Entrepreneur,"We launched our wallet pass platform just over three weeks ago, and I'm genuinely amazed at the response.","In January of this year, we started building a new product for my company, FanCircles. We've been providing direct-to-fan solutions for the past nine years in the form of super-fan apps. But there was one problem: Super-fan apps only work with music artists and music artists that can fill venues more than 2,000 capacity. We needed an entry-level product that worked for everybody. And so we began work on what later became called PushPass. PushPass is a wallet pass platform which has some unique features and benefits. First of all, let me describe the mechanism of how this works. Wallet passes are generally used for loyalty. But some, like ours, allow for push notifications which can include links to anywhere. So our journey began having discovered that the Google wallet only last November and added the ability for push notifications to work from their wallet. This opened up a massive opportunity. That opportunity was to mass onboard brands, and allow them to create their own wallet pass design, and onboard their customers into what I think is prime real estate within a user's mobile wallet. Once a user or customer has a pass in their wallet, notifications can be pushed and points can be collected for various actions from clicking on links in notifications through to sharing their loyalty card with their friends through the QR code, or on the pass. This is where things get interesting because not only does it build customer loyalty, it also grows the audience for a brand through viral marketing of pass holders sharing their pass with their friends, while at the same time earning them points. The more points you collect, the more prizes you get. I'm not sure if I understood the breadth and the use cases of this when we began. But now I'm astounded by the feedback we're getting as customers were onboarding. Already in just three weeks, we've onboarded a major record label, a U.S. clothing brand, several YouTubers, and a pharmaceutical company selling products for hair care. Even more incredibly, I truly am shocked at the speed of this. We've issued over half a million passes, and they are being actively used. This is also a little bit of a surprise. YouTubers are using it within their videos by showing QR codes to join their VIP community. Brands, such as the clothing company we're working with, are preparing their press and TV ads to include access to their loyalty card. This opens up so many opportunities simply because most QR codes are used to sell something. When people just aren't ready to buy, of course they want a connection with the brand they love , but a sale doesn't usually come at the time a fan connects with a brand. So I just wanted to share this success story simply because I didn't expect it to be so big.

Basically I want to offer a full maintenance package, once a month I come inspect you car, if it needs an oil change I do it, if it needs a trans service I do it, engine and cabin air filters, fuel treatment, etc. there's probably a dozen or so little maintenance things you should do for you car but most people don't know and don't want 6 or 8 up charges and things along with I don't like to sound like some pushy sales guy however I am passionate about preventative maintenance. I know how much it's neglected generally and many people aren't very educated on how to take care of their car so I feel like if I just made it a monthly service they don't have to think or worry it's just done. So my idea was simple, what if I made it a monthly subscription, I was thinking 125 a month I come out, I inspect their car and just do any and all maintenance on it (I would have a maintenance schedule like oil changes, trans service, engine and cabin air filter, MAF sensor cleaning, EGR valve cleaning, throttle body cleaning, fuel treatment, spark plugs, etc. just about everything you should get for your car). My thought of the price would go up if your a frequent driver and need those services more and lower if you don't drive often. So my question is how should I go about piloting this or offering it and how should I try to figure out pricing so I can ensure I profit off this. I also don't want to buy bulk bottom of the barrel products I want to ensure I'm using mid grade or higher quality materials, fluids and filters so it actually makes a difference",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1okj990/advice_for_piloting_a_new_service_for_my_business/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1okhcr8,2025-10-31T01:09:35,Entrepreneur,"I extracted ideas from 1,000 top Reddit business posts, then repeatedly synthesized them. This is the final playbook.","Spent way too much time analyzing 1,000 of the most upvoted posts from Reddit's top business communities. My goal was to find the patterns, the advice that gets repeated so often it's practically law. After extracting and repeatedly synthesizing the key insights with an AI pipeline, a clear 5-step playbook emerged. These are the rules this community lives by. # The Reddit Founder's Playbook (TL;DR Version) * Validate Before You Build. This is the #1 rule, repeated like a mantra. Your idea is worthless until someone is willing to pay for it. * Action: Create a landing page. Describe the problem you solve. Collect emails. If you can't get 50 signups, your idea is likely dead. This hurts but saves you months. * Don't Build What's Already Built. Your job is to solve a unique problem, not to reinvent infrastructure. * Action: Use off-the-shelf solutions for solved problems. The biggest one? Authentication. Use Clerk/Supabase/Firebase. Don't write your own auth system. Ever. * Go Where the Pain Is. Your first customers aren't on Google Ads. They're in forums complaining about the exact problem you solve. * Action: Search Reddit/forums for ""\[Competitor\] sucks"" or ""how to solve X"". Help people genuinely, then mention your solution. Launching on Hacker News (Show HN) is a rite of passage. * Sell Painkillers, Not Vitamins. ""Nice to have"" products fail. ""Need to have"" products succeed. * Action: Find a problem that costs businesses real money. If your $50/mo SaaS saves a company $500 in wasted time, it's an instant sale. Focus on boring, expensive problems. * Your First 10 Users are Your Co-Founders. Building in a vacuum is a death sentence. * Action: Create a Discord or Telegram on Day 1. Invite everyone who signs up. Ask for their feedback on everything. They will give you the insights you can't see and become your biggest advocates.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1okhcr8/i_extracted_ideas_from_1000_top_reddit_business/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1okg43z,2025-10-31T00:12:15,Entrepreneur,My barber took my advice and now business has never been busier,"My barber does a great job cutting hair, but like most barbershops, the prices are a bit steep these days ($30+, plus tip). Personally, my hair grows very fast, so if I wanted to keep it clean, I would easily have to get my haircut at least once every two weeks or so. It also doesn't help that I don't have the greatest neckline (i.e. it looks messy once my hair starts to grow out). However, paying that much money just wasn't something I was willing to do so I would wait longer than I wanted to between cuts. My barber mentioned to me that business wasn't doing well. This wasn't a surprise to me because his shop was rarely busy. I have no barbershop experience but I do enjoy thinking of ways to make businesses more efficient and profitable. I suggested that he try this: offer basic (not bad) haircuts that he could do quickly & efficiently, for a lower price. This would mean no skin fades and no use of scissors (I know this might sound crazy but a previous barber of mine only used clippers and it worked completely fine for my shorter hairstyle. He had longer clipper attachment guards so this isn't a matter of everyone getting a short buzzcut) because that also rules out longer hairstyles, etc. There is a market out there for people like myself who are wanting basic haircuts and would get haircuts more frequently if the price was lower. He took my advice and he has never been busier. There is almost always someone waiting in line for a haircut, and he has even implemented a numbering system. He charges $22 with no tip option. Although the price is lower, his chair almost always has someone in it and he gets through his haircuts much faster. Something I want to stress again is that these are not bad haircuts. These are just simple (compared to some other haircuts out there) haircuts. Yes, I know cutting your hair at home is an option but that is irrelevant to this. There are many reason why someone may not want to cut their own hair, and also, some people do skin fades on themselves so a basic haircut does not automatically mean that someone can do it themselves.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1okg43z/my_barber_took_my_advice_and_now_business_has/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1oka9pu,2025-10-30T20:09:14,Entrepreneur,"I left my $6K per month full-time remote job and started my own marketing agency. Here I am, 12 months later.","Hi, **Background**: I was doing well at my job. It was a newly launched staffing agency based in NJ. At that time, it had no clients. I worked there for about 3 years and established the brand. Then, I decided to work for my own business, I resigned on Sep 26. On October 1st, I started my own marketing agency. I registered an LLC and secured a few projects in the first month. They were small companies with less than 10 employees, as I wanted to start with smaller ones. I am into lead generation and have about 15 years of experience, so lead generation is like a daily task for me. All my 5 clients want to grow their businesses by getting more customers. They don’t care what I am doing, what methods I am working on, or how much social media is helping. Nothing. They just NEED MORE BUSINESS. That’s it. **The Real Struggle Starts Here:** To deliver the desired results, I have been spending 8 to 10 hours daily, thinking about new strategies and ideas. I have dedicated one whole day to each project. On Saturday and Sunday, I review the past work and make strategies for the next week. There are no off days, no relaxing days, no holidays. I get up in the morning, open my two laptops, and the same process starts again. I hired many resources and employees to share my work, but they could not meet the clients’ expectations. So, my employees just follow my instructions. These are low-paying projects, that’s why I cannot hire experienced people like project managers, etc. Furthermore, due to this stressful workload, I couldn’t market my own agency. Its social media pages are inactive. I used to write on Quora and had millions of views there, but now I hardly post once a week. After all expenses, I am earning less than $500 per month now. That means around $6,000 per year, while this was the amount I used to earn every month earlier, working only 8 hours a day, no stress, full 9 hours of sleep, and a peaceful mind. **The only positive thing I have achieved here is the happiness of my clients. They are getting the leads they expected from me. In fact, my clients love me, and I love working for them.** But I think I cannot take this stress anymore. 1. Either I have to choose decent clients who can pay me what I truly deserve, 2. Or go back to a full-time job again and offer part-time marketing consultation. **What I learned** 1. Every business wants more clients, not more noise. That’s what I help them get, real, measurable growth. Just wish I had more time to do the same for myself. 2. Sometimes, chasing freedom ends up costing peace. But even if it’s tough, I’d still choose my own path, because lessons like these can’t be learned in a 9-to-5. 3.

The goal is to make university living more affordable, sustainable, and community-driven. Right now, most students use Facebook Marketplace or IG/Snapchat stories for exchanging things like textbooks, dorm furniture, sublets, course/exam notes, etc. It works, but it’s messy, spammy, and sometimes unsafe. My idea would focus on verified students only (through their school email), keeping transactions local and trustworthy. As an aspiring entrepreneur, this idea is one of many I’ve explored, but it’s one that feels genuinely rooted in a real problem I see and experience every day. At the same time, I do wonder whether there’s enough real demand for something like this, or if it would be too niche to stand on its own as a sustainable business. Do you think there’s a real business here, or is the market too small / fragmented? What challenges would you expect with scaling something like this across campuses?

1ok3oi3,2025-10-30T16:02:15,Entrepreneur,A lesson I learned the hard way while building a website for a digital agency client,"When I was starting out as a freelance web developer, I got a client who was launching their own digital marketing agency. They wanted a website that would represent them as a *young, modern, AI-driven* team, but they had no real direction. No theme suggestion. No page structure. No reference content. Just a few websites they liked and one single case study. Their only input was, *“We just want it to look modern and professional, something that tells our clients we’re creative and a team full of youngsters.”* At that point, I had two thoughts: 1. This could be a great opportunity to experiment creatively. 2. Or it could turn into one of *those* never-ending projects. I quoted ₹30K (\~$340), but after some negotiation, we settled at ₹15K (\~$170). I assumed it would be a quick portfolio-style website with Home, About, Services, Contact, and one Case Study. But then they wanted to *see* the design first before I started development. So, I hired a designer for ₹10K (\~$112) to make a proper 5-page layout (They paid for the design). Once the design was approved, I started development. Two weeks later, I had the entire site built and ready and then they wanted to add 5 new case studies, 8 blog posts, change text, update images, tweak layouts and every change led to another “small change.” One month of continuous revisions later, the site looked nothing like the original design. It wasn’t bad, just not what we initially discussed. Still, they were happy with it in the end, which was a relief. But for me, it was a major learning experience. What I thought would be a small, easy project turned into a 1.5-month-long commitment. I didn’t charge for extra work because I wanted to maintain the relationship and build my reputation. Looking back, I realise that’s not sustainable. Now, I always make sure every client understands the scope clearly, what’s included, what’s not, and how we’ll handle revisions. I still give my best, but I also value my time and experience. If you’re a freelancer, this might sound familiar to you, too. If you’re a client, trust me, the clearer your requirements are, the better your project will turn out. It’s been one of those early lessons that completely changed how I handle clients and projects today.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ok3oi3/a_lesson_i_learned_the_hard_way_while_building_a/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

Do you give them real projects or mostly busywork? Because I'm trying to figure out if I should have them shadow me for a month first or just throw them into something useful from day one.

How many interns do you typically have on staff? I'm wondering if two is even a good number or if I'm overextending myself trying to manage them while still doing everything else. Some founders I know swear by having 3-4, saying it creates momentum and they can pair interns together.

I grew up in New York City, and at 19 I moved to Istanbul, Turkey, where I studied for 10 years. During that time, I worked as an interpreter for several hair transplant, dental, and plastic surgery clinics. Now that I'm back in the U.S., I realized I could build a consulting company connecting people here with trusted, high-quality clinics in Turkey - especially since I've seen so many shady or low-quality operators in this space. Right now, I'm connected with three top-tier clinics - one of them is run by a plastic surgeon with 22 years of experience (17 in hair transplants) who even trains other doctors in the field. Here's what I plan to offer: Hair, beard, and mustache transplants Plastic surgeries (rhinoplasty, breast lift, face lift, liposuction, etc.) Dental procedures (veneers, implants, etc.) Non-surgical cosmetic treatments Vacation experiences in places like zmir and Antalya Istanbul itineraries that highlight hidden gems and local spots Optional multi-country trip planning with a travel expert friend of mine (he's been to over 100 countries and finds amazing flight deals) - e.g., clients could visit Europe first, then stop in Turkey for 3-7 days for their procedure and recovery. I've already set up: A website Instagram and TikTok (just starting, barely any followers yet) What I'm struggling with is: 1. How to stand out from competitors offering the same services for suspiciously low prices. 2. How to show credibility - that the clinics I work with are truly world-class and not part of the ""cheap, risky"" crowd. 3. How to communicate all of this clearly across my website and social media without overwhelming people. 4. What early steps or growth strategies you'd recommend for a consulting company like this - partnerships, ads, content ideas, etc. Would love to hear from anyone with experience in travel, medical tourism, consulting, or just growing a service-based business. Thanks in advance - any insights, even blunt ones, would mean a lot. - TL;DR: I started a company connecting Americans with high-end clinics in Turkey for hair transplants, dental work, plastic surgery, and vacations.

These things are all very positive hustles and their contributions to humanity cannot be ignored. They can be extremely lucrative. For the vast majority, they are not entrepreneurs. One way to always tell is that if they glorify the hustle. Not a single real entrepreneur that I know does that. Because it is so fucking hard and they are so afraid of losing everything they have built, they don’t want to challenge the powers of the universe to take it all away. Sure. IG culture makes it look promising. These are not entrepreneurs. They are content creators. Some of them could make it without their content. Some cannot. Content creation is lucrative. But most of them destroy entrepreneurial ventures (see Logan Paul and Prime). They are not prepared for the challenge because they cut every corner with their attention. He’s still rich af. But that’s not the only goal for the real ones. Becoming an entrepreneur is the most difficult journey you can undergo as a professional. If you start off with money or a trust fund, 99.9% of the time, you won’t have anywhere near the grit to survive. It’s that hard that money cannot even solve it and having it is actually a detriment. “Takes money to make money.” No it don’t. At least in the USA it does not. If a real entrepreneur was living your life, they would create value out of the oxygen you breathe and raise equity out of the water you drink. Value is everywhere. Your sad little excuse is numbing your drive. Entrepreneurs are born with something we cannot explain. It’s more a virus than a positive characteristic. Most entrepreneurs lose friends and family during their path. It’s not because we are bad people, it’s because nobody who isn’t an entrepreneur could possibly understand what makes us tick. Even people who have the same disease, but have not taken the ultimate leap of faith, cannot relate in the slightest. The closest people in your life don’t understand you in the slightest. And you have to respect and admire them for that, or you will have to eventually sign them off. That happens. And it hurts terribly. I have a good friend who posted recently on IG about his hustle and being down to his last $1,000 (cash rich in many entrepreneur’s lives, including my own in this current moment). He didn’t say that his dad paid for his car and rent and trust fund. He is glorifying something he knows nothing about. It’s not that he is a bad person. It’s that he is ignorant, lacks intellect, and has no idea what he’s doing. Although it has all the indications of a game, this is not a game. It’s far closer to war than it is to Monopoly.

That’s when it hit me ideas aren’t useless, but a good idea in the wrong hands might as well be.

1ojqqgb,2025-10-30T04:46:12,Entrepreneur,"UPDATE: Raised rates 50% on nightmare client, went silence. Then this counter offer","Quick update to my previous posts about the nightmare client situation. Context: one client makes up $5k per month which is almost half of my revenue. They've been complete chaos, disorganized records, 2am receipt dumps, constant weekend emergencies. I posted asking if I should fire them and Reddit overwhelmingly said raise rates and set boundaries instead. I sent an email last week raising their rate from $5k to $7.5k per month and included an actual service framework with 10-day submission deadlines, rush fees for last-minute requests, communication hours Monday through Friday 9am-6pm only, and no more weekend work. They went silence for a week. I was legitimately convinced they were ghosting me and started mentally preparing for losing half my income. Yesterday they called me and we had this tense 20 mins talk with lots of questions and pushback, but I honestly couldn't tell where it was heading. This morning, I got their email response and I'm honestly conflicted about what to do. Screenshot attached. They want to move forward but counter offer $7k per month instead of $7.5k. They're also pushing back on the timeline, saying they want to start with 7 business days deadlines instead of 10 and work up to it over the next quarter. And here's the one that's really bothering me, they accept the Monday-Friday 9-6 communication hours but want to discuss exceptions for quarterly filing periods where some weekend work might be necessary. They did acknowledge that they kinda expected this coming given how they've been operating, and they need 90 days to review how it's working. But I'm genuinely torn here. Part of me says take the deal because I won the principle, $7k is still a 40% increase, and some of their pushback seems reasonable for a transition period. Part of me says hold firm because I set $7.5k for a reason, that quarterly exception language feels like the exact slippery slope back to weekend chaos, and they're already negotiating boundaries before even accepting them. I'm leaning more towards the take the deal part.

1ojeftz,2025-10-29T19:42:03,Entrepreneur,Why do influencer marketing platforms cost $2K-5K/month when the workflows are pretty simple?,"We run an influencer marketing agency and I've been trying to understand the pricing model of SaaS platforms in this space (AspireIQ, CreatorIQ, GRIN, etc.) What they do: * Creator database/search * Messaging system * Campaign management (basically a CRM) * Payment processing * Basic analytics What they charge: * $2,000-5,000/month * $24,000-60,000/year * Often require annual contracts * Transaction fees on top What I'm trying to understand: From a technical perspective, these aren't complex features. It's essentially: * A database with search filters * Chat functionality * Workflow management * Stripe/payment integration * Standard analytics dashboards So why the enterprise pricing? Is it: 1. Small addressable market? Only large brands can afford it, so they charge accordingly? 2. High CAC? Enterprise sales are expensive, so they need high ACV to justify? 3. Value-based pricing? If a brand spends $500K/year on influencer marketing, $24K for software is only 5%? 4. Moat building? High switching costs once you're locked in? Why I'm asking: We've built internal tools for our agency that do 90% of what these platforms do. Our dev costs were maybe $50K. I can't figure out why the market sustains $2K-5K/month pricing when the technical lift isn't that high. Are we missing something? Is there hidden complexity we're not seeing? Or is this just classic enterprise SaaS pricing (charge what the market will bear)?

1ojdrk5,2025-10-29T19:16:37,Entrepreneur,Hard work aaaaand Luck,"back in 2019 i wanted to work for this really cool bike brand. they had this position open for a working student app developer only problem... i couldnt develop apps. they liked my enthusiasm but (obviously) said no. that kinda hit me but also motivated me. i decided: ok fine, then i’ll just learn how to build apps myself. we didn’t learn app development at university, so i had to figure it out on my own. and like everyone else i needed a first project. the standard beginner project is a todo list app, but there are already like 9,849,386 of those. so i thought, what’s something similar but maybe a bit more fun. i came up with the idea of a **wishlist app**. i just wanted to make something i’d actually use myself. looking back, that was already my first lucky pick. from 2019 to 2021 i worked on wishlists here and there. slow growth, tiny user base, but i kept going. the app wasn’t great, but it was mine and it taught me a lot. then i started my first full time job as an app developer. and at that job i had to learn **flutter**. wishlists was ios only back then, so i thought, perfect, i’ll just rebuild it in flutter to practice. no big plans, no deadline, just learning. that rebuild ended up taking **two years**. two years of coding after work, fixing stuff, trying things out, not really knowing where it’s going. but rebuilding it in flutter was a total game changer. suddenly it was cross platform (ios + android), way cheaper to run, and opened up a whole new audience. and honestly, that was another piece of luck. if my job hadn’t required flutter, i probably never would’ve rebuilt it at all. by pure coincidence, the rebuild finished right before the 2023 holiday season. literally weeks before people started making their christmas wishlists. the timing could not have been better. the app had been burning like $500/month in server costs and wasn’t profitable at all. if the update had been ready even a month later, it probably wouldn’t have survived. but somehow it was ready just in time. and suddenly downloads exploded, server costs made sense, and for the first time it actually made money. now wishlists has around 1.2 million registered users, about 110k active users every month (5x during holidays), makes around $6k/month on average and up to $60k during christmas season. no investors, no ads, no tiktoks. and somehow it still ranks in the top 3 on the app store worldwide, even though other apps have way more reviews. i still work my ass off on it every day, fixing stuff, improving, helping users. but i’m very aware that luck played a big part in all of this. if that bike company hadn’t said no, if i hadn’t needed to learn flutter for my job, if the rebuild hadn’t been ready exactly before christmas, none of this would’ve happened. so yeah. hard work matters. but sometimes, the universe just lines things up for you. hard work aaaaand... a bit of luck.

Today I had a sudden realization and I feel horrible after looking at the inflation calculator today and how much money I was making earlier in my career vs now. I wasted a lot of my time pursuing easy money when the slightly less easier money was right there in front of me all along. I wanted to be rich but I drove myself poor looking for easy money. Pursuing dreams that were too big or unattainable. 25 years ago, at the age of 20, I was a college dropout after 2 years with horrible grades. Raised in a shithole country and in that country's shithole village everyone from the country made fun of. I move to the US, buy myself a Geo Metro and my first job I'm getting Today's equivalent of $25/hr, within 5 years, at 25, I was pulling around $165,000 of today's money a year. I had built up a business that I could have built back up again at any point in the last 20 years, but after a divorce and killing the business out of spite, I decided to take a break and get an associate's degree. This business was easy. I used to say ""I'm going to a client's house to take their money"" because it felt like robbery. In those 5 years, I had a string of jobs in troubleshooting, networking, web development, etc. I just absorbed all these things. In comes my wife who had a master's and I felt emasculated so like an idiot, I spun my wheels getting a master's degree. WHY THE HELL DID I DO THAT WHEN I WAS EASILY PULLING $165,000/YEAR?! As soon as I graduated, I got myself a job paying $120,000. I have a nervous breakdown because the work was horrible. What do I do?

The way investors looked down on me even though I felt I was so accomplished. For several years I pursued getting funding, developing the service, over engineering it. For what?! I'm living off unemployment. Why didn't I just go back to IT consulting? After that, I decide, well, I'm going to do web development because I can just project manage the work and keep the money.

Because Fiverr and Upwork can actually be a microcosm of the real business world and will give you great insights into demand generation and marketing strategy. Why? **Lessons from Fiverr and Upwork** **Niche, knotty and relevant services sell very well** on these platforms. Those nitty-gritty knotty tasks that are technically small but tricky and relevant to other freelancers / business operators are much in demand. **Business Lesson:** Sell a niche, knotty and relevant service. Nice-to-have services (e.g. Lifecoach) don't sell at all on these platforms. Niche and knotty problems have a second market too. A lot of sellers of these are actually selling to agencies that lack the in-house capability (or have no desire to build it, since it's more efficient to outsource and let their employees focus on the core work). **Business Lesson:** Never think that the end-user is your main market; sometimes, your primary market is another player in the supply chain. You can go broad in Fiverr and Upwork, but there is a catch. If you decide to go broad or offer a general service (like website design), you must have a large number of genuine reviews. **Business Lesson** Testimonials make or break you if you're selling a broad service. **Bonus Lesson concerning Upwork** \- *Most of its users (suppliers and buyers) find the platform painfully slow and lumbering to use and from my experience, and some buyers and suppliers will do everything possible to do business outside the platform. People absolutely hate slow websites!*",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1oj4w2r/business_strategy_lessons_from_fiverr_and_upwork/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1oj3jm1,2025-10-29T12:45:36,Entrepreneur,Story creation on autopilot.,"Helped my friend automate his story content channel using n8n - he's saving 3+ hours daily My buddy started a short story channel on TikTok in March. The format works great for engagement but he was spending 4-5 hours per video and burning out fast. I've been messing with n8n for workflow automation lately so I offered to help. Took about two weeks to build out a system that handles the whole pipeline. The workflow breaks down like this: Story prompt comes in, GPT writes the script and splits it into scenes, another node generates slide designs for each scene, text-to-speech handles the voiceover, then everything gets stitched together with proper timing. Outputs a ready-to-post video. What I learned building this in n8n: The modular approach is perfect for content pipelines. Each step is its own node so when something needs tweaking you're not rebuilding everything. Way more flexible than trying to code it all from scratch. Error handling matters more than I expected. AI tools fail sometimes. Built in fallbacks and retry logic so the whole thing doesn't crash if one API hiccups. Cost optimization was interesting. Running everything through one workflow vs multiple helped cut API costs significantly. Also caching certain outputs that don't change much. The timing sync between slides and voiceover was the hardest part. Had to calculate durations dynamically based on text length and speech rate. Took way more iterations than expected. My friend went from barely keeping up with 2-3 posts a week to posting daily. Started a second channel. Actually has time to analyze what content performs and iterate on strategy instead of just grinding production. For anyone running content operations or thinking about it, automation isn't just about saving time. It's about making things actually sustainable so you don't quit after a month. Happy to answer questions about the n8n setup or workflow automation in general. Also curious what other people are automating in their businesses?",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1oj3jm1/story_creation_on_autopilot/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1oj19p0,2025-10-29T10:50:40,Entrepreneur,The most viral Launches in 2025 and what you can learn from them,"I follow many founders on social and probably saw most of the launch videos that went live this year. Most looked identical. The ones that went viral? They broke every rule. Here are the ones that caught my eye and what I think made them work: **1. Edlog: “We’re building AI for couches.”** Yes, that’s the real opening line. A guy in an ‘80s suit, smoking a cigarette, talking about AI for couches. It sounds absurd, and that’s why it worked. Total pattern break. Turns out it’s actually an AI platform for furniture retailers. *Lesson:* Weird works. If people stop scrolling to figure out whether you’re joking, you’ve already won. **2. Emergent Labs: “Everyone’s got an idea.”** Two founders talking over coffee about how everyone wants to build something. Then: *“What if you had an on-demand CTO who actually ships?”* It’s authentic, founder-led, and perfectly timed for the AI-coding moment. *Lesson:* Relatability beats production value every time. **3. ULearn: Just a founder talking to camera** No fancy effects. No voiceover. Just the founder explaining the product and screen-sharing how it works. It shouldn’t work, but it feels honest. *Lesson:* Authentic > perfect. When you’re genuinely excited about what you built, people feel it. **Bonus: Snowglobe (Guardrails AI): The self-driving car metaphor** The video opens with: *""This car was tested on millions of scenarios before I could ever ride in it. What if you could test your AI agent on thousands of simulated scenarios before you launch them?""* It's a talking-head format (founder Shreya on camera), but the hook is a visual metaphor that makes AI agent testing instantly understandable. Self-driving cars → AI agents. Testing simulator → Snow Globe. The video hit 2M+ views because it made something complex feel familiar. *Lesson:* When you're explaining technical products, find the metaphor everyone already understands. Self-driving cars are universally known. The bridge between them is what made this stick. Across all of these, one thing stands out: **execution matters as much as the idea.** The difference between a launch that flops and one that hits 2M views? Usually the team behind the camera.

1oj0go3,2025-10-29T10:03:44,Entrepreneur,I thought building a good product = automatic sales. Spent a month learning I was dead wrong,"Hey everyone, sharing this because I wish someone had slapped this into my head earlier. I've built 3 SaaS products now. One completely failed, one makes \~$100/month, and the latest one has made $172.50 total. Not life-changing numbers, but here's what I learned that actually matters. When I launched my current product, I got a few sales pretty quickly. I was pumped. ""Ok, the product works, people are paying, now I just need to keep improving it and sales will come naturally, right?"" No, it's not. I spent the next month checking my dashboard every single day, seeing basically the same numbers. Maybe one sale here and there. I kept tweaking features, fixing bugs, making the product better. Still nothing. That's when it hit me. I had a product that people would pay for, and I was killing it by not marketing. The product wasn't the problem. Nobody knowing it existed was the problem. So I finally went all-in on marketing. Reddit posts, X, Hacker News. Anywhere I could genuinely share what I built and get feedback. Not spammy stuff, just real posts about what the product does and why I made it. The difference was insane: * First month (barely any marketing): 0 to 10 users * One week of actually marketing: 10 to 23 users Same exact product. The only thing that changed was that I stopped waiting for people to magically find it. I see so many founders (including past me) think the game is: * build good product → get users → get paid. But we skip the most important part. The actual game is: * build good product → market it → get users → get paid. Your product doesn't matter if nobody knows it exists. Marketing isn't optional, it's not something you do ""later when you have time."" It's the difference between a product that makes money and one that sits there doing nothing.

1oj0eld,2025-10-29T10:00:31,Entrepreneur,Stop marketing on Reddit,"Most marketers crash and burn on Reddit in their first week. Reddit is quirky. It has alot of its own rules, and they all vary sub-by-sub. People are (rightfully) brutal if you try to solve a problem they don't have by selling them your product. But if you play the long game, it can be one of the best platforms for building trust and driving real conversions. Alot of people's ICPs don't even hang out on Reddit. **1. Stop selling. Start contributing.** At the start (top of the funnel), your goal is to get noticed without promoting your product. Jump into discussions, answer questions, share what you’ve learned. Be the helpful expert, not the person pushing links. This is why the autoreply name-dropping marketing bots don't work. No one owes you a click. They owe you nothing until you’ve given them something useful. **2. Build trust through depth.** Once people recognize your name (middle of the funnel), you can share deeper insights. Things like case studies, hard lessons, honest pros/cons between tools (even your competitors). People respect transparency. “Here’s what we tried, what worked, and what didn’t” does more for your credibility than any ad ever will. **3. Earn the right to mention your product.** At the bottom (bottom of the funnel), that’s when you can *occasionally* drop your link. When someone literally asks, “What do you use for X?” If your answer adds value and you’re upfront about being the founder, people appreciate it. Redditors hate stealth marketing, but they love real founders who hang out and help. **4. Think in Reddit metrics, not ad metrics.** Forget clickthroughs and conversions early on. Look for upvotes, saves, thoughtful replies, profile visits, and people mentioning you later in other threads. Those are your signals you’re doing it right. **5. Keep showing up.** Once folks buy from you, don’t disappear. Keep supporting them in threads, celebrate their wins, and use their feedback to improve. That’s how you turn Reddit users into advocates who promote you *for free*. Reddit’s brutal to marketers who act like marketers, and it massively rewards the ones who act like real humans. Contribute first, ask later, and the conversions come naturally.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1oj0eld/stop_marketing_on_reddit/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

It was 10x harder than I ever imagined.","I just finished my journey building online service, and wanted to share the story, mostly because it was brutal, and really not easy. I was obsessed with the relationship compatibility market because I have noticed that many people start to care about it. As we see with apps like CoStar and ThePattern. But I found them incredibly fragmented. They only explains about astrology. I saw a niche not for another simple tool, but for combining other concepts. So, I built RelationScope. It's a web app that fuses four different systems into one comprehensive report. Astrology, MBTI, Four Pillars of Destiny(which is very popular in South Korea), and Face Reading. **The Lesson Learned:** Honestly, the tech stack was the easy part. The real battle, the part that almost made me quit multiple times, was the crushing self doubt and isolation I faced every single day or every single minutes as a builder. Finding the niche felt like a win. Committing to the idea felt like progress. But the brutal part was the 1,000+ hours of coding, bug-fixing, and redesigning, all while wrestling with the constant fear ""Will anyone even care? or Will anyone know this service even existed? or What if it is total waste of my time?"" My biggest takeaway is that building a business isn't just about code or marketing; it's a psychological endurance test for sure.

1oivz8r,2025-10-29T05:07:37,Entrepreneur,real vibecoding opportunity: internal mobile apps for SMBs (made $30k in 2 months),"**A bit of context** I have been building mobile apps for a long time. I also ran an agency in Europe that shipped consumer apps. In the last two years I learned as much as in the eight years before. Consumer can work, but it is hard. There is a lot of competition. Many teams are funded. Good branding and design matter. Ads and store strategy matter. Vibecoding helps with speed, but it does not give you product sense or design skills. Most solo builders don’t have all of that. **What this is about** I started building internal mobile apps for small businesses. These apps are private. The icon has their logo. The data is theirs. The app runs one important job their team does every day. Owners can build it. Or a builder can build it for them. The value is simple: fewer mistakes, faster hand-offs, cleaner records, money collected sooner. **What the apps do, in plain terms** Field work: the worker arrives, taps “start,” takes photos, collects a signature, taps “done,” and the invoice is sent. Studios and salons: bookings are kept in one place, reminders go out on time, no double booking. Shops and wholesalers: scan items, update stock, get a clean export for accounting. Forms and compliance: fill forms offline, require all fields, get a signed PDF saved in the right folder. **Pricing and learning to watch** Some platforms look cheap, then get expensive with seats, credits, or add-ons. Read what counts as usage. Check if you can export the project. Check who owns the data. Test the tool before paying. Plan time to learn it. One focused week now is cheaper than rebuilding later. **What must be solid** These are utility apps. One core feature must work every time. If the core is booking, the app must not lose state. If the core is notifications, they must arrive on time. If the core is inventory, scans must be reliable. If the core is forms, offline must work and signatures must stick. Nice screens do not fix broken behavior. **Ownership and scope** Keep the brand of the business. Icon, splash, wording. Keep the data with the business. Keep roles simple. Decide if the app is only for staff or also for clients to see status or book. Fewer options means more use. **A simple way to build and improve** Make a small version that runs end to end. Put it on the phones of the people who do the job. Watch where they get stuck. Fix the biggest problem. Ship again. Repeat once or twice. When it feels smooth for them, brand it fully and roll it out. **How to build** I am technical, and for this kind of job I would not use Cursor. I would pick a mobile-focused vibecoding platform with three qualities: a good code model that handles real app logic (not only UI), built-in help for store tasks like signing, builds, TestFlight or internal testing, and App Store and Play submission, and clear pricing that stays reasonable without surprise per-seat or credit spikes. I use Vibecode App. It is free to start, the credit system is fair, and it is easy to ramp up.

1oiqvu1,2025-10-29T00:50:57,Entrepreneur,Things I Learned After Starting a Web Design Agency at 17 and Our First Day as an Ai Agency,"**Before the Shift to AI, My Past Experience with Websites** Before getting into Ai, my friend and I ran a small web design business at 17, building websites for local construction companies and contractors. It was our first real experience working with business owners and learning what they actually needed. During that time, I learnt a few things: * Most businesses don't need better looking websites, they needed more customers. * Even the best website meant nothing if no one was there to answer the phone or follow up. * Communication and accessibility mattered more than websites. I started to realize that the websites we built looked great, but they didn't fix the main issue, which was that websites weren't attracting or converting customers. A website can attract customers, but only if there is something that is actually driving people to it. This is a part that most business owners forget. A website is basically a front of a store. It can look clean and professional, but if nobody walks in the store, none of that matters. Most websites fail because they rely on hope: * No traffic coming in * No Follow up system * no automation * no one responding fast enough So even if the site looks good, it isn't doing anything for the business. That's when I realized design alone wasn't enough. Businesses needed a system that started conversations, captured leads, and followed up. Around that time, we discovered Ai, and we saw how people were using it to automate messages, calls, and followed up. After learning briefly about Ai, we decided to stop designing websites and start automating for businesses to fulfill their need of availability for clients. That's how we decided to start an Ai agency. **The First 6 months, what the website business looked like** **Months 1-2:** We spent the first two months learning how to design, build, host, and deliver a website. We were also asking people we knew if they had any referrals in need of a website and trying to get a case study. It was mostly trial and error, but it build the foundation for our eventual shift to Ai. **Months 3-4:** We finally landed our first client through a referral. It took us around a month to finish their website. Seeing that first payment hit our accounts was one of the best feelings, and it seemed like all the learning was worth it, and we were heading somewhere. **Months 5-6:** We started Cold calling to get more clients. A few people booked online meetings, but most never showed up. Even one of our potential clients we met with lost interest afterwards. This taught us that our business was not going to scale if we continued down this path. **What I learned from Web Design** 1. Websites are limited without automation. A visually appealing website doesn't mean much if it doesn't connect to real conversations. 2. Design earns trust, but results keeps clients. Good design can attract client, but communication is what keeps them connected. 3. Every business has the same main issue which is com...",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1oiqvu1/things_i_learned_after_starting_a_web_design/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1oimqgl,2025-10-28T21:55:33,Entrepreneur,"My product launch was a complete failure (<5 users). Instead of giving up, I documented every mistake I made.","I come from a technical background, and I used to believe the Silicon Valley myth: ""build it and they will come."" I was wrong. My partner and I launched several high-quality software products and were met with absolute silence. Our user count was less than five. It was a brutal but necessary lesson that a great product is useless if no one knows it exists. Instead of quietly shutting it down, I decided to analyze every single mistake I made on the marketing front. Here are the highlights: **Mistake #1: Confusing ""Broadcasting"" with ""Marketing"".** My first attempt at ""building in public"" was just me posting technical logs. No one cared. I learned that marketing is about starting conversations, not just shouting updates into the void. **Mistake #2: Relying on Automation Too Early.** I built a clever system to find potential users on Reddit. But my automated, contextless messages were just spam. The real progress came when I started having one-on-one conversations in niche Discord communities. **Mistake #3: Underestimating the Power of Community.** I treated platforms like Reddit as a place to drop links. Result? I got banned. I now have a multi-week ""account warming"" strategy focused on providing value before asking for anything. **Mistake #4: Launching a Product Instead of a Brand.** Our Product Hunt launch flopped because we were just another faceless tool. We've since pivoted to building our brand as a development team, sharing our entire journey wins and (mostly) losses. The biggest takeaway for me is that persistence is the only strategy that truly works. It's about showing up every day, even when the numbers are depressing. I wrote a full, brutally honest breakdown of this journey, including the tools and platforms that eventually started to show a glimmer of hope. If you're in the early stages and feeling discouraged, my story might resonate.

1oiilu5,2025-10-28T19:17:11,Entrepreneur,Should I grow now or wait till I can hire people and move to a bigger location?,"Hey everyone, I have a question. I quit my job in March and took a $5K credit loan to start my own online reselling business from home. I got my LLC, bought all the essentials like a printer, boxes, computer, and desk, and started sourcing products in bulk from wholesalers. I opened an eBay account and for the first two months I was selling at a loss just to feed the algorithm. Eventually, I started seeing enough movement to raise my prices and still make a profit. The business slowed down a little, but it did not matter because I was finally generating income. Then I expanded to Walmart and TikTok Shop. Later, I decided to go on Amazon, which was very rough and almost ruined me financially, but with hard work and dedication I made it profitable. Right now I am able to pay all my expenses, my car payment, insurance, mortgage, and utility bills, and still have about $1,000 left each month. I usually either save that or reinvest it back into the business. Now I want to open my own website so I do not have to rely on third-party platforms. I am pretty good with social media ads and I have been able to drive traffic from TikTok and Facebook to my products on eBay and TikTok Shop. I currently handle around 50 packages a day on the slow days and I do everything myself, packing, shipping, and customer service, seven days a week, 12 hours a day. My concern is that opening a website might be too much for me to handle right now. I am not ready to hire employees yet since I have not even hit one full year in business. I am planning to move into a small 1,500 square foot office space and hire help once I reach that one-year mark, but part of me does not want to miss out on potential growth by waiting.

But the reality is, AI today is pacing much faster than the data. The world is still struggling with digital transformation, data quality, and integrity. I wonder if AI can stay healthy and ethical. I must confess I’m on the backfoot with AI (even after a masters degree). Not slowing down the innovation, but just standing on the sidelines, watching the world grow nerve-tight excited about it. And guess what, AI ministers, frauds, penalties, and layoffs are no more breaking news. Yet, by the end of the day, AI still sweeps in billions.

1oihtt9,2025-10-28T18:47:24,Entrepreneur,Leaders: What's your biggest challenge on team leadership? Let's help each other.,"So I've been a team leader-coach for like 1.5 years, and founder since 3. I like team coaching, that's my whole approach as a leader. My team is fully autonomous now, literally like having 6 intrapreneurs. We went from individualistic and toxic culture to value-aligned supportive team. My passion since the beginning was ""how to create an empowering culture"", the profits came as a consequence. Now I'm leaving my company to join someone else's project in a founder position. It's cool and exciting, but meanwhile I want to keep perfecting my team coach skills. So there's no trick: lets talk about team and culture challenges. And see what we can learn from each other. Questions to spark conversation: How do you actually know when to let go of control and trust the team? Is this easy for you or hard? What happens when you delegate too soon? What’s your current team culture struggle? trust, accountability, motivation?

1oih4wk,2025-10-28T18:21:23,Entrepreneur,Anyone else notice productivity systems can actually make burnout worse?,"I think there are a three kinds of burnout. The first is when you hate what you do and yet you need to do a lot of it. That's the typical job burnout. We all know that one, it's why we're trying to get out of the 9-5 in the first place. The other is working on something you do want to do, but working way too hard without giving your body enough food, sleep, or exercise. This one is slippery because the passion often runs high and we forget ourselves. The third one is working with the wrong set expectations. You expect to be ramen profitable in 6 months and you're at $60 MRR after 10. Or you launch to a mailing list with 400 people and get 2 signups and nobody responds to your emails. That kind of thing. Our of all three, the third one I think hits entrepreneurs the worst. If you think X should take 1 week and it takes 6 months, you'll work much harder than you can sustain, ignore your body, and end up with the second form as well. If on top of this, you believe this is the only way to do it but you hate it (e.g. marketing means writing content), you'll procrastinate all day, and then try to do it late at night, hate yourself for procrastinating, hate yourself even more for hating the work, wonder why do you even need to do it, and maybe even wonder what you're doing with your life in the first place. The next morning you'll recommit to never procrastinate again and pick up a brand new productivity system, habit tracker, task manager or accountability buddy. And promptly dig yourself into even a deeper hole because you never resolved your resistance to what you're trying to do in the first place. Systems have their place. Discipline has it's place. Grit has it's place. But when you consistently procrastinate on something (marketing anyone?) and burn out *without actually making any progress*, and one system after another doesn't help, you've got to ask yourself what's actually wrong. And it is very unlikely to be the productivity system.

1oifijm,2025-10-28T17:21:28,Entrepreneur,"This Wasn't the ""Easy"" Entrepreneurship I Was Sold...","When I first got into entrepreneurship more seriously, I watched YouTube videos about it (it was the golden age of ""here in my garage"") and I really believed it was going to be easier than having a job. Be your own boss, work when you want. Freedom. That's what everyone talked about in those YouTube videos. They made me think that once I had control over my time and my decisions, life is going to feel lighter, like it would be all sunshine an rainbows from that day on. But that is exactly the opposite of what happened. I traded predictable routine for constant uncertainty. I traded ""clocking out"" for working all day and thinking about work 24/7. I traded external pressure to internal pressure and honestly, that one is much heavier. There were days I woke up already stressed. There were days where I questioned whether I had any idea on what I was doing. I thought that meant I was doing something wrong, that it isn't for me, I should give up and pursue a ""normal"" life. But I realized that my mistake wasn't the way I was doing it, my mistake was believing it was supposed to feel easy in the first place. Being an entrepreneur isn't supposed to be easy. The difficulty is the filter. It's what separates the people who like the idea of entrepreneurship from the people who are actually built for it. Most people don't quit because they're incapable, they quit because they can't sit with discomfort. They need reassurance, steady dopamine, predictable process. Entrepreneurship doesn't offer much of that. It requires you to do boring and hard things, repeatedly, without immediate reward or validation, sometimes with no reward at all. You might even get ""punished"" for it. It asks you to keep going even when there's no guarantee. It forces you to grow, and not because you want to, but because there is no other choice. Once I understood that, the hard parts stopped feeling like signs of failure, they were just something that I need to go through. This wasn't the easy entrepreneurship I was sold, it has been much harder and much more uncomfortable than I expected. But honestly, I wouldn't want it any other way. That's exactly what makes me better, that's exactly what makes achieving things feel that much more rewarding. Anyone can want success, but the willingness to stay in the discomfort, that's what proved who's actually meant for this. # ""We are what we repeatedly do.

The first two months were rough. I was obsessed with features wake words, animations, multi-language and forgot about retention. We had 300+ signups, but barely any paying users. Then 3 things changed everything: 1. **Narrowed the audience.** Instead of “everyone who likes AI,” I focused on *freelancers and founders* who actually use multiple tools daily and need a faster workflow. 2. **Shortened the onboarding.** The first-time setup went from 10 minutes → 90 seconds.

We work with founders who are ready to retire but are genuinely concerned about their legacy. We frequently see two common, painful outcomes when founders finally step back: 1. The business is acquired by a large, impersonal fund that cuts staff, changes the brand, and dismantles the culture for a quick return. 2. The founder lacks a clear plan, and the business slowly winds down, taking jobs and a great reputation with it. We are looking for input from this community: **Beyond just maximizing the price, what steps can founders take to ensure their company, their employees, and their reputation are truly preserved during a transition?** Please share your experiences on these transitions even from the perspective as an employee who witnessed a transition.

Here’s a deep dive from our internal dataset on what actually drives opt-ins via subscription forms — across industries, triggers, design, and campaign timing. # Executive Summary This report provides an in-depth analysis of subscription form performance for the goal Grow Email List. It benchmarks global opt-in conversion rates, examines industry differences, and highlights key factors driving higher conversions. Our findings show that gamification mechanics (e.g., Spin-to-Win), strong value communication (discounts, urgency, clear offers), and centered, high-visibility CTAs consistently outperform generic newsletter sign-ups. Industries like fashion and beauty lead with the highest conversion rates, while SaaS and media lag behind. Seasonality (BFCM, holidays) significantly amplifies conversion uplift. The report includes actionable insights and a 7-step checklist for marketers. **Methodology** * **Dataset**: Our widget performance dataset. * **Scope**: Widgets with w\_goal = Grow Email List. * **Sample size**: 875 widgets across 214 unique sites. * **Impressions analyzed**: 14.7M total impressions, 473k subscriptions. * **Metrics**: Conversion Rate (CR) = Subscribers ÷ Impressions. Reported as mean, median, p75, p90, p99. * **Weighting**: Both unweighted averages (per widget) and weighted CR (impressions-based). * **AI-vision analysis**: Computer vision + NLP on widget screenshots identified design/layout features (alignment, CTA visibility, use of visuals, urgency cues). **Data Sources** * **Our internal widget statistics** (2023–2025). * **AI-vision enriched dataset** (design, CTA, visuals extracted from screenshots). **Global Opt-in Conversion Benchmarks** # Overall popup conversion rates (2025) * **Average CR (mean)**: 3.2% * **Median CR**: 0.9% * **Top 25% (p75)**: 3.6% * **Top 10% (p90)**: 8.5% * **Top 1% (p99)**: 16.7% # By Device * **Desktop**: 2.9% * **Mobile**: 3.6% *(mobile performs slightly better due to fullscreen takeover formats)* # By Region * **US**: 3.1% * **EU**: 2.7% * **UK**: 3.9% * **Canada**: 3.5% # By Triggering * **Exit-intent**: 3.8% * **Time-delay (5–10s)**: 2.9% * **Scroll-depth (50% page)**: 2.4% * **Click-triggered (on element)**: 4.1% # By Layout * **Centered popup**: 4.3% * **Left-aligned**: 2.8% * **Right-aligned**: 3.0% (low sample size) * **Fullscreen overlay**: 4.7% * **Slide-in (corner)**: 1.8% # By Targeting * **All visitors**: 2.1% * **Returning visitors**: 3.9% * **Cart abandoners**: 6.5% * **Product viewers**: 3.3% **AI-Vision Insights (Design Factors)** AI-vision analysis revealed that **high-CR widgets** share these traits: * Centered layout with strong CTA contrast. * Clear offer copy (“15% OFF” vs “Subscribe for updates”). * Use of urge...",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1okbao5/email_list_conversion_insights_benchmark_report/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

I tried calling and the automatic voice said to basically call later, though I have a feeling I'll be in limbo in that respect for a while. Do I already have the EIN, and that's why it refused the second time, or did it deny me without saying anything? Is there any way to make this process go faster? The only problem I think might come up is that my legal business name has an apostrophe on it (SpeeDee's Delivery Service LLC), but the IRS website wouldn't allow me to use an apostrophe (SPEEDEES DELIVERY SERVICE LLC).

Details: Been around for 40 years Seller is retiring Seller only works 20 hrs/week Has part time manager that works the other 20 hrs/week and pretty much does everything at $25/hr Been stagnant over the last 3 years but predictable at ~780k revenue ~220k SDE Current owner pays himself ~100k/year Contracts are basic and have a 30-day cancellation but not auto-renewing. They currently do no marketing, little to no sales efforts. My background is in sales and I know I can use that experience to increase top and bottom-line numbers. Thats where I believe the greatest opportunity is in this deal. Asking price is 765k... Thats a 3.4x multiple (roughly) which to me seems high. The broker says he has other offers already for around that price and needs it to retire. Seller is also not open to any seller-financing. My question: I feel like I'd be overpaying at 765k. But I also know that looking at it from the big picture, thats a nominal amount over 10, 15, 20, however many years I choose to own it. Is the DSCR enough to even qualify for an SBA?

We operate in a **billion-dollar industry** (some estimates put prepaid card waste at over $100 billion a year), but it's an industry built on consumer frustration. # The Consumer Problem We Solve 😩 If you've ever gotten a prepaid gift card (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, etc.) from a rebate, a gift, or a promotion, you know the pain: 1. **The Small Balance Problem:** You're left with a few dollars on a card that's too small to use easily, yet too much to just throw away. That money is essentially locked. 2. **The ""Split Payment"" Headache:** The card gets rejected at checkout because the balance is less than your purchase total, forcing you into a frustrating split payment process. All that trapped value adds up. That's money people earned or were given, but they can't access it easily. # Our Solution: Prepaid2Cash We built a simple, safe way to **cash out your prepaid cards** directly to you. * **How it Works:** You submit your card details through our secure app. We verify the balance and pay you the agreed-upon amount (minus a service fee) directly via **ACH (bank transfer), PayPal, or even check.** * **The Big Win:** We turn that frustrating, locked-up card balance back into **real, liquid cash** you can use for anything. You can find the official **Prepaid2Cash** app on both the **Apple App Store (iOS)** and the **Google Play Store (Android)**. # 🤝 Partnership Opportunity: Join Our Network To better serve this massive market, we are actively looking for new partners! We are seeking to integrate with established and **aged payment processors**—such as **Stripe, QuickBooks, and Square**—to expand the channels through which we can liquidate card balances. If you are a processor with an aged account and are interested in a mutually profitable revenue stream, we offer a generous incentive: **Earn 10% per transaction** that flows through our network. Contact us directly to explore joining our partnership ecosystem. We're excited to keep growing and helping people solve this widespread financial annoyance.

After weeks of research and talking with support, here’s what actually helped me fix the issue **without violating Google’s rules**: 1. **Used business-verified payment methods** – debit/credit cards that match the account name. 2. **Set up a proper billing address and domain email** (no generic Gmail for ad billing). 3. **Created clear landing pages** that describe real products/services — transparency matters. 4. **Avoided running multiple new accounts simultaneously** — it triggers flags. 5. **Maintained consistent IP/location** when managing accounts.

How to overcome this?,"Remote work has been good for our small team, but we're hitting a connectivity ceiling. We transitioned from in-office to fully remote during Covid, and I'm grateful we can offer this flexibility. Remote work is here to stay for us. But our teams are becoming increasingly siloed. I'm not sure how to describe it, but I don't want a ""cold"", dry, company culture. Is there a way to bridge that gap without micromanaging or forcing interactions that feel artificial? We've experimented extensively with virtual workspace platforms, and I've learned they're not all created equal: * If it's just Zoom with a different UI, employees won't engage. * Resource-heavy platforms create barriers. We tried Kumospace and loved the functionality, until laptop crashes and performance issues made it unsustainable for team members with older hardware. * We've since moved to a platform with a retro pixel-art aesthetic that's less resource-intensive. It's not as feature-rich, but the lower friction means higher adoption. What's worked for us so far: * Make it lived-in, not transactional. We give each employee a customizable desk or office space. Personalizing avatars and workspaces creates ownership. They're not required to use them though. * Leadership sets the example. Our leadership team conducts internal meetings on the platform and stays logged in (cameras off is fine). Once employees saw they could ""walk over"" and start a conversation with their managers, adoption increased. * We hold biweekly all-hands in the virtual workspace at a time zone that works for most people. Each team shares updates, which helps give each other insight in what you're working on, but I can tell most people still walk away without feeling connected. So we're definitely not where I want to be. How have you reduced silos without sacrificing remote work independence?

These products are doing well, customers like them, and finding new suppliers means starting over with samples and testing. Plus my holiday inventory orders are supposed to go out in 3 weeks. Checked Alibaba for alternatives and found similar products for about 20% less than the new prices. But who knows if the quality is the same or if they're reliable.

1ok0jlp,2025-10-30T14:01:36,smallbusiness,More VS New - What questions to ask myself in order to make decisions clear?,"Short Introduction: I'm the Founder of a small business that sells two physical products at events, one of the products is just an addition to the main product. The events are weekend only during the winter months and 3-4 days a week during spring and summer. I started this business in June having graduated university. I have one employee which is a friend from school and he works exclusively on the events. The business revenue averages since June £15k per month with a net margin of around 40%. Some Context: I'm at a point now where my friend and I are pretty good at selling our product in person, the set up that we take to our events is not jaw dropping but pretty good. Essentially, what we currently have going is working. (In my opinion) I was also at an event recently where a local retailer set up 3 gazebos and rammed it with products. Bare in mind their products are all well established brands. After the event I asked how much revenue they did.... On the first day they did 4x ours, on the second they wouldn't tell me. However, the most surprising part of it all is they had no sales process, the people who worked those days did no selling, no outreach and no closes. Stood there and watched the money flow in. Now I understand selling well known established branded items is going to help given the recognisable names, but I also think a part of it was the presentation. Everything was so well presented, clear and easy to understand.... It looked professional. The Dilemma: New: Seeing what the retailer was able to do sparked the idea to launch new products. (Cash is not a constraint I have). Get 5 products in my event set up, expand it and take ideas from the other guys to present them professionally. Even if those 5 other products sell 10% as well as my main product it will effectively 2-3x the profitability of the business. The cons of launching new products: I currently drive in a Peugeot 308 SW to my events, it's an estate and has a lot of space for what I currently have but will not have enough for all of the other products and their displays. Secondly, and the main one really. It's hard enough to manage stock, profit/losses, social media posts, website, organising the events and everything else during the week already. Since it's just me trying to improve all of these things incrementally takes a lot of time. I'm not sure I'll be able to do all of that + launch new products, especially considering my new products are going to have sizes and designs. - A lot of admin work. More: No new products, just more ways to sell in person. I have been speaking to some shopping centers that are local to me, the rates are good and I can sell 7 days a week. If I'm able to do close to the sales of that at the events it would be phenomenal money for my age. (Fixed costs are lower - no travel expense, no hotels etc). The shopping centers are 7 days a week, mainly 8am-6pm. Whereas the running events start at 7am and finish around midday.

1ojqrhd,2025-10-30T04:47:50,smallbusiness,From idea to steady weekend business: what I learned running a hospitality side venture in Toronto,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share a few insights from building a hospitality-focused side venture here in Toronto that’s grown into a consistent revenue stream over the past couple of years. The idea started small, I noticed an opportunity in the private events space where guests cared about experience, not just convenience. I built something mobile, premium, and tailored, and started serving small private gatherings. Word of mouth took off faster than I expected. Over time, I learned a few key things: • People will pay for presentation and reliability, not just the product itself. • Referrals are everything, one good event can lead to a dozen if you focus on client experience. • Managing growth is tricky, scaling while maintaining quality is the hardest balance. • Building a strong local network of event planners and suppliers is more valuable than any ad campaign. It’s still a compact operation, but it’s profitable, repeatable, and fun, especially since it started as a weekend experiment. Curious if anyone else here has built service-based ventures that rely heavily on in-person execution? How did you handle the balance between keeping it boutique and scaling sustainably? Appreciate any insights, always trying to learn from others in the space.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ojqrhd/from_idea_to_steady_weekend_business_what_i/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1ojpyjq,2025-10-30T04:02:33,smallbusiness,Seeking Feedback on Funding a Medieval Castle Wedding Venue + Bee Farm/Meadery in Maryland,"I’m refining a business plan for an agritourism venture in Maryland: a medieval castle-themed wedding venue (150+ capacity) with a bee farm and craft meadery on 10–20 acres in the DMV area (within 2 hours of DC). I’d appreciate advice on funding strategies, revenue assumptions, and connecting with MD investors before pursuing capital. Project Overview: * Concept: A 10,000–12,000 sq ft castle-style venue for weddings, fantasy balls, and corporate events, paired with a 25–50 hive bee farm and small-batch meadery. The medieval theme targets couples and fantasy fans, with mead/honey tapping MD’s agritourism and craft beverage growth. * Location: Targeting rural MD and VA counties (e.g., Frederick, Carroll) for land ($50K–$100K/acre) and zoning incentives. * Total Startup Cost: $3.5M–$6M (mid-range $4.75M), including: * Land (10–20 acres): $500K–$2M * Venue construction (themed): $2M–$4M * Bee farm (25–50 hives): $10K–$50K * Meadery (tasting room, equipment): $100K–$300K * Permitting/design: $150K–$400K * Revenue Projections (Year 1–3): * Weddings: 30–50/year at $15K: $450K–$750K * Fantasy balls: 3–6 events, 100 attendees/event at $200: $60K–$120K * Corporate events: 3–6 at $10K: $30K–$60K * Bee hives: 25–50 (\~500–1,000 lbs honey total) * Honey: 250–500 lbs at $15/lb: $3.75K–$7.5K * Mead: 125–250 gallons at $100/gallon: $12.5K–$25K * Total: $556K–$962K/year, 20–30% margins (based on MD venue data). * Competitive Edge: No MD venues offer a medieval castle theme, unlike standard barns (e.g., Milton Ridge). Fantasy balls align with Renaissance fair demand; mead rides 20% CAGR in craft beverages. My Background: I work in a stock exchange-related role, with experience in financial modeling. I’ve researched land (50+ parcels), prefab construction, and permits via government databases. I’m collaborating with photographers, wedding venue operators, and small business owners for insights, with LOIs in progress. Funding Plan (Draft): * Personal Contribution: $100K * SBA Loan: Targeting $3.8M–$4.275M for land, construction, and operations, needing $475K–$950K down payment (10–20%). * Other Sources: Crowdfunding ($50K–$100K, pre-sold weddings/mead), friends/family ($100K–$200K), grants ($50K–$150K, e.g., MD Ag Innovation). Questions for Feedback: 1. Is my funding mix (SBA, crowdfunding, grants) viable for $4.75M? How much angel capital should I seek later? 2. Are agritourism startups appealing to angels? How do I pitch the medieval theme effectively? 3. Any MD investor networks (e.g., TEDCO) or winery partnerships to explore? 4. Are my revenue ranges ($556K–$962K) realistic? Should I adjust wedding or mead assumptions? 5. How do I address my lack of entrepreneurial experience with investors?",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ojpyjq/seeking_feedback_on_funding_a_medieval_castle/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

I’m onboarding a 1099 psychiatrist on a 70/30 split (in their favor). We submit insurance claims, get direct deposit into my business bank account, and patient copays are collected through IntakeQ integrated with Stax which then also go to my bank account Right now I have no idea how I’m going to manually calculate the split and pay the psychiatrist monthly. I’m looking to streamline this: • Ideally I’ll do a reviewed manual payout once a month. • I want the system to calculate how much the psychiatrist is owed automatically based on the payments collected via Stax(does stax seperate this from what I make as well)? • No expenses to subtract — just divide the gross receipts that go through our system. • I’m comfortable with tech and willing to set something up myself Questions for the community: 1. Can IntakeQ + Stax support this split payout automatically, or do I need an external tool/integration (Zapier, Make, etc.)? 2. What systems or workflows have other small practices used to manage contractor splits like ours? 3. is there a setting in stax that I can run this?

With Zomato, Swiggy, and all the online ordering booming, do restaurant, hotels, cafes,or even street food spots actually need AI to scale? Or is AI an overkill. To give context, here is what AI automation can do: 1. Lead generation and qualification: Automatically captures inquiries from zomato/google/review/forms, then AI scores them (eg., ""High-intent dinner reservation"") so you only chase real customer not spams. 2. AI Chatbot/Caller: 24/7 English/Hindi customer service that handles ""menu? Table for 4?"" And books reservation instantly. Reduce no-shows by sending reminders. 3. Follow ups and nurture system: Auto-drips messages like ""Loved our biriyani? 20% off next visit"" to bring back customers. Turns one-time eaters into regulars. 4. Payment & Reporting dashboard: Secure UPI deposits for bookings + gentle reminders (“Confirm your table or cancel?”). Cuts unpaid bills and last-minute flakes. 5. analytics and reporting dashboard: Daily WhatsApp reports: “5 tables booked, ₹28k revenue today.” Helps spot peak hours or slow menus 6. CRM Sync: All customers data (from bookings to preferences) auto synced to google sheet or Zoho, easy to search ""Ramesh's favourite dish"" Is this stuff even helpful for you guys in restaurants/hotels/cafes?

My profit margins were pretty terrible and my supplier overcharged me for my products. My products still sold, and I assumed my product was popular enough that I could just up my price. I learned that the customers didn't value my product at a high price. My business was moving way too fast and I was moving fast with it. I released 12 items on black friday, and that was when everything fell apart. I took out a loan which was very very VERY stupid you of me. Its so crazy of how much you can learn in so much little span of time that you realize how much of an idiot you were.

1ojcmr5,2025-10-29T18:34:33,smallbusiness,Fixed a Flawed Marketing Tool and Built a Profitable Automation Stack,"I’ll be honest the original idea wasn’t mine. I noticed that something was flawed, took the concept, and executed it better. Here’s how it unfolded. A few months ago, I came across a tool that was charging hundreds of dollars to help “submit your startup to directories.” It seemed appealing at first a clean user interface and bold promises but the actual results were disappointing. Half of the directories were inactive, the founder wasn’t responding to support tickets, and users were expressing their frustrations on Reddit and X about how it didn’t work. Rather than complaining, I decided to rebuild the service faster, cleaner, and more reliable. I scraped over 5,000 directories, narrowed them down to about 400 that were still active and indexed, and created systems to handle the submission process automatically. Then, I added what I felt was missing: human oversight. Each submission was verified, duplicate checks were implemented, and a random manual audit ensured that the AI didn’t submit poor-quality listings. The result was [GetMoreBacklinks.org](http://GetMoreBacklinks.org) a directory submission SaaS that automated 75% of the tedious work while still maintaining high quality. I launched modestly. There were no ads, no Product Hunt launch, and no influencer posts just me engaging in SEO and indie hacker discussions, sharing data, and being transparent. Results: Day 1: 10 paying users, Week 3: 100+ live listings, Month 6: $30K in revenue, All achieved by improving what someone else had only half-finished. The lesson? You don’t always need a brand-new idea. You just need to execute an existing one with care, speed, and genuine empathy for the user. If anyone is interested, I’m happy to share the list of directories that actually worked and the exact QA checklist I use before submitting.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ojcmr5/fixed_a_flawed_marketing_tool_and_built_a/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

My doodles, regardless of size, start at $100. Recently, a groomer opened up in her house in my town but she only grooms 3 days a week and nothing over 40lbs so I have an advantage that most clients don't want to go to a home for grooming.

I then went to a digital rewards through my pos with the same system but it was $50/month and half my clients didnt want to input their number.

That's not a 'wink-wink write-off', I really am there with my little vendor table trying to find leads or find new ways to teach. In total: I'm estimating I'll make about $5,200 in 2025 doing this. I then use a SEP-IRA and will be depositing the maxed 25% pre-tax, so knock the remaining income down to $3,900. This is my THIRD year filing as a business, the first two years I showed a smaller loss buying up a lot of this gear and traveling. My income has grown considerably compared to starting out, but it looks like I'm still in the red. I need to report a profit the next three years to avoid hobby status. All the equipment is really being used, not a single personal item or cost. The travel is real.

They are good at their jobs overall. There have been reports of them stealing which I have not been able to truly see and thus have not acted on. They are seen as lazy by the majority of others in there, and i can not disagree but they are also have values that they bring.

The format works great for engagement but he was spending 4-5 hours per video and burning out fast. I've been messing with n8n for workflow automation lately so I offered to help. Took about two weeks to build out a system that handles the whole pipeline. The workflow breaks down like this: Story prompt comes in, GPT writes the script and splits it into scenes, another node generates slide designs for each scene, text-to-speech handles the voiceover, then everything gets stitched together with proper timing. Outputs a ready-to-post video. What I learned building this in n8n: The modular approach is perfect for content pipelines. Each step is its own node so when something needs tweaking you're not rebuilding everything. Way more flexible than trying to code it all from scratch. Error handling matters more than I expected. AI tools fail sometimes. Built in fallbacks and retry logic so the whole thing doesn't crash if one API hiccups. Cost optimization was interesting. Running everything through one workflow vs multiple helped cut API costs significantly. Also caching certain outputs that don't change much. The timing sync between slides and voiceover was the hardest part. Had to calculate durations dynamically based on text length and speech rate. Took way more iterations than expected. My friend went from barely keeping up with 2-3 posts a week to posting daily. Started a second channel. Actually has time to analyze what content performs and iterate on strategy instead of just grinding production. For anyone running content operations or thinking about it, automation isn't just about saving time. It's about making things actually sustainable so you don't quit after a month. Happy to answer questions about the n8n setup or workflow automation in general.

I was posting regularly, trying new hashtags, and watching tutorials, but still, there was no real growth. I was using: * Hootsuite for scheduling * Notion for captions * Google Drive for photos * and random screenshots from Meta for analytics It was just too much. Everything felt messy, and I’d spend hours managing posts instead of creating them. A few months ago, I tried a tool called **Indzu Social** because it looked simpler (and was way cheaper than Buffer or Hootsuite). Didn’t expect much, but it honestly made things a lot easier. After that, things finally started to move. I went from **around 800 to 4,600 followers in 3 months.** Here’s what helped the most * I could plan a full month of posts easily and see how my feed would look. * All captions and hashtags stayed in one place. * The analytics showed me when my followers were most active. * It gave me quick post ideas when I was out of inspiration. No magic trick or overnight success it just helped me stay consistent and organised. Once posting became easier, my content quality improved too. I still use Hootsuite for one client (they don’t want to switch), but for my own pages, I stick with **Indzu Social** because it saves me a lot of time.

I WILL NOT PROMOTE,"I’m a longtime game developer who’s finally taking the leap to start my own studio with a cofounder. Between us, we’ve got a lot of technical experience and industry contacts. Mostly other engineers, developers and artists, but not much overlap with the investor side of the startup world. We’re building a co-op focused ARPG that’s designed as a Games-as-a-Service title... something in the AA space that emphasizes teamwork and long-term player retention rather than just single-player content with tacked on multiplayer (I hope that's not breaking the rules of mentioning the startup... I just thought that the nature and scope might effect the responses). We’ve been putting together a prototype, a pitch deck, and a business plan, but as we look at the next steps, I keep realizing how different the game studio path seems compared to a typical tech startup (i.e. product doesn't reach market until much later and validation is done through the hype you generate before any sales take place). Most of the information that is out there is about typical startups that want to get their product to market as soon as they have something that looks like a MVP, which isn't typically what games do. I was thinking about reaching out to other founders that have raised money for their studio in the preseed and seed levels within the last few years, but I'm not sure that an unsolicited message without an introduction is appropriate. Questions for others: \- What should be done differently between starting a game studio and raising funding vs a typical startup? \- Is it appropriate to cold contact other founders for advice, wisdom, warnings, and possibly leads/connections/resources? And if so, are there any caveats to the etiquette for doing so?

We’ve had moderate success, able to pay ourselves for years although not a competitive salary. My CTO is a talented back end and full stack gap-filling engineer. I’m the hardware engineer, and I also do essentially everything else to keep the company running. We could both make more money in corporate, but we’re passionate about the company and vision. My CTO has built a lot of software over his years working on our products, but he’s had long periods of utterly minimal contribution due to what I think is undiagnosed depression. There will be months at a time where not a single line of code is written and no PRs are reviewed, but he will show up to meetings, contribute ideas, and coordinate with our contractors, but the often tedious IC work just won’t get done. We’ve managed for this long by just being flexible and accommodating. Hardware derives the majority of revenue and it’s easy to push software deadlines when the apps are free. He will eventually come back around and help move product forward, but in the meantime our software has lagged quite far behind our competitors. We recently announced a new hardware product I’ve worked on basically single handedly for the past couple of years and it went far better than expected. This is my baby, I did everything from customer research, design, firmware, built countless prototypes, and so much more. We have more signed pilots than I can manage with giant multinational companies. Paid pilots are starting in Q4. During this process, our software has been completely stagnant. The new product is going to require an overhaul of the apps, and we’re totally unequipped to make that happen. I’m not sure what to do. My CTO has given so much to this company, and I refuse to screw him over. At the same time, we have an opportunity that’s bigger than anything we’ve had before and I essentially don’t have a CTO, or really a cofounder. I’m afraid that if we take on these deals, and use the money they give us to build out the software side of the company, our lack of software leadership will doom us.

1okiikr,2025-10-31T02:04:00,startups,Trust yourself (I will not promote),"So here I am again. Another idea and the will to get something off the ground. I had founded a logistics company specializing in cargo management and consolidation using our algorithms to maximize load capacity. I started it when I was in college with my then girlfriend (now wife) and literally started from the ground up. We grew the company to 10mil in 5 years and life was good. I had no VCs, angels, just me, my wife and my dad. So things started to get quite boring, every “major” issue became predictable, revenue was growing but not myself. I felt like the business itself had put a cap on my desires and love of the game. So, I got another idea about an app. Bootstrapped it with revenue from my existing company and decided to plunge in the world of Silicon Valley. Logistics was tech heavy but no where near the levels of whatever is happening in the tech space. I am quite technical and have a deep understanding of systems design and architecture. But somewhere in my mind I thought, I am incompetent when it comes to tech. Is anyone going to take me seriously? Fuckin tech bros from meta, google, probably will laugh at my capabilities. So i went the hiring route. I had quite a bit of money and decided, “hey lets hire 3 bright engineers and get the show on the road”. Hiring went well, everyone was aligned and I took a step back because what would a “trucker” know about anything (so I thought) 1 month of development became 2, that became 3 and stretched to 5. I kept thinking, “shit is my idea that complicated?” So I took the word of the devs and stayed off the steering wheel. Just the usual business admin work, make pitch decks, registration and shooting the shit while the devs worked. I hated every second of it. I hated it so much, i started developing apps in the meantime just for fun because this shit was taking too long. Then 1 day it just hit me. I wanted to do an extensive code review and see wtf is going on. The code review yielded that our backend engineer was a sociopath who had graphql, codegen, complex CTE for search, insane amount of tech debt etc. Front end yielded extremely spaghetti code, copy/paste development, essentially give cursor crack and it will write that type of code. Then the backend engineer quit, cause he got too “overburdened”, and my two other engineers were dumbasses and shit was just falling apart infront of me. So i was driving back home from a conference in LA for tech week and me and my wife sat in silence for 30 minutes. Both depressed, and willing to just say, “dump and move on”. I suddenly had an awakening, like, I am an engineer through and through and there is no way in hell I am going to let these 3 clowns screw up everything. I bought a pack of parliament lights, 5 redbulls, and sat down at my desk and started building. It took me 5 hours to get the backend up, and another 20 hours to get the front end up and communicating. I developed the UI/UX and just went ape shit.

""i will not promote"" i","Spent way too much time analyzing 1,000 of the most upvoted posts from Reddit's top business communities. My goal was to find the patterns, the advice that gets repeated so often it's practically law. After extracting and repeatedly synthesizing the key insights with an AI pipeline, a clear 5-step playbook emerged. These are the rules this community lives by. # The Reddit Founder's Playbook (TL;DR Version) * Validate Before You Build. This is the #1 rule, repeated like a mantra. Your idea is worthless until someone is willing to pay for it. * Action: Create a landing page. Describe the problem you solve. Collect emails. If you can't get 50 signups, your idea is likely dead. This hurts but saves you months. * Don't Build What's Already Built. Your job is to solve a unique problem, not to reinvent infrastructure. * Action: Use off-the-shelf solutions for solved problems. The biggest one? Authentication. Use Clerk/Supabase/Firebase. Don't write your own auth system. Ever. * Go Where the Pain Is. Your first customers aren't on Google Ads. They're in forums complaining about the exact problem you solve. * Action: Search Reddit/forums for ""\[Competitor\] sucks"" or ""how to solve X"". Help people genuinely, then mention your solution. Launching on Hacker News (Show HN) is a rite of passage. * Sell Painkillers, Not Vitamins. ""Nice to have"" products fail. ""Need to have"" products succeed. * Action: Find a problem that costs businesses real money. If your $50/mo SaaS saves a company $500 in wasted time, it's an instant sale. Focus on boring, expensive problems. * Your First 10 Users are Your Co-Founders. Building in a vacuum is a death sentence. * Action: Create a Discord or Telegram on Day 1. Invite everyone who signs up. Ask for their feedback on everything. They will give you the insights you can't see and become your biggest advocates.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1okhb2r/i_extracted_ideas_from_1000_top_reddit_business/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

(I will not promote)","Hey everyone, I’m a 20-year-old university student who’s been pondering/doing some light research on a business idea: a campus-exclusive marketplace that connects students to buy, sell, and rediscover the “essentials of campus life”. The goal is to make university living more affordable, sustainable, and community-driven. Right now, most students use Facebook Marketplace or random group chats for things like textbooks, dorm furniture, sublets, course/exam notes, etc. It works, but it’s messy, spammy, and sometimes unsafe. The idea would focus on verified students only (through their school email), keeping transactions local and trustworthy. As an aspiring entrepreneur, this idea is one of many I’ve explored, but it’s one that feels genuinely rooted in a real problem I see and experience every day. At the same time, I do wonder whether there’s enough real demand for something like this, or if it would be too niche to stand on its own as a sustainable business. Do you think there’s a real business here, or is the market too small / fragmented? What challenges would you expect with scaling something like this across campuses? Would it make more sense to stay niche (textbooks/course notes only) before expanding? Is there a more effective way to solve this same problem, maybe an approach I’m not seeing yet?

We are at a stage where we've done our research and there is a real use case we can pursue. The issue is we don't know who should be CEO. Of the 4 of us, let's put 2 folks aside as they want to do other things (tech, product, etc.). I'm trying to decide between my friend and me, let's call him John. John and I, while both technical, have business experience. We have overlapping skillsets. John initially suggested we be co-CEOs, but after we talked about my passion for the idea and vision, he said he's okay with me taking the CEO title. Even so, he's a natural leader and has expressed that he wants to be the one talking with investors and getting the money. However, I came in with the idea, I have a vision for execution, and I want to focus on talking with customers and the overall execution. I would like to be at the forefront of signing deals as I have a knack for being a good speaker. John is a PM at his day job so he's really good from an operational delivery standpoint. We've both been told we can sell a product well. The idea revolves around something that I am so much more passionate about. John is a great asset because he comes with business acumen and will probably be more rational. I'm thinking of proposing that I take the CEO title to focus on vision and sales (customer-facing), and John takes a CPO or COO title to own the product/operations and partner with me on fundraising. For context, we are bootstrapping for the first 2-3 years as funding isn't necessary. Our business will require us speaking with other financial institutions at a later point, to which John expressed his interest in spearheading. This seems like a perfect fit for his role. Is this a fair way to divide the domains, or will this lead to a fight? This might come off as a rant post, but I am not sure who should be in charge. Yes, I understand the titles don't mean much in the beginning but I want to establish domains to create accountability. When we incorporate, I want to add everyone in the founder documents (like our Stock Purchase Agreements), as we are taking equal equity (everyone is on board with the risks, capital needed etc.) If there are any details that are unclear or missing, please lmk and I'll be happy to provide. thanks in advance for the insight.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ok5ih9/cofounder_conflict_how_to_pick_a_ceo_when_we_have/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1oj9xzs,2025-10-29T16:56:21,startups,How making a professional looking Product Demo Video paid off instantly -> 2 B2B Deals app downloads and conversion increased (i will not promote),"Wanted to share my story regarding demo video production and how it instantly paid out. **WHY?** Well, actually its really important to have a top quality video for marketing since you can use it for: * YouTube * Landing Page * Product Hunt * Linkedin * App onboarding screen and well even in emails * Pitch Deck * Apple Store and Google Store * Reuse it in Insta/Tiktok or Ads Honestly, now I just show the video instead of explaining my product over and over. Saves so much time. And its waaaay better than having static images - now everyone consumes video. **HOW?** I both know video and sound engineering from back then when I was involved in video and music projects during my student years. I kind of was hoping that the there are some awesome new AI tools to actually do it real fast and smooth. NOPE. Its actually a really fragmented process. (Might be someone wants to actually build something - i would pay). Anyway, you still would need at least iMovie and some screen recording tool (you can also use your native screen recorder - but then the frame is not there and no zoom ins). So in the end I used Final Cut, Screen Recording software and the one AI tool for voice over if found on PH. That AI tool costs 200$ or so, but you can actually export video with watermark and just extract the audio - anyway thats what I needed anyway - so i can put audio on the video. ***Step-by-step-guide*** *(You can do it!)* 1. Record your screen 2) Add all the zoom ins and cool effects 3) Open in iMovie and cut a first version with your most important 3-5 features 4) You need to have a Master Project which you will always reuse and just duplicate to make videos for any platform 5) You can add voiceover or AI voiceover and save it as a track 6) Create requirements file for each video type 7) Cut and Export for each platform **IMPORTANT** Don forget that each and every platform has its requirements or limitations. \* Landing Page -> the video must be compressed (shorter than 1 min) and hosted on some CDN so users dont experience long loading times. \* Apple Store -> this is the worst, just hate them. Basically there are too many requirements and I gave up for now \* YouTube, PH, Linkeding - you want the best quality you can get and it can be 3-5 mins. **RESULTS** Was this 2 Days time investment worth it? **100% yes** * Landing page → download conversion: **3x increase** * Download → signup conversion: **+20%** * Closed 2 partnerships (15k attendee festival + 10k attendee conference) via cold emails with video attached * Everything looks more professional now, got tons of positive feedback I'll probably use this video for the next 3 months until my next big update.

But I just had an unguided chat with a user, and realized that even that was more helpful than 100 basic survey responses. It landed on my plate very last-minute, and I didn't have time to prepare anything. So I just hopped on the call and chatted with them. Everything from what they got up to today (and sharing what I did too), to how they got into their current career, to what other challenges they're facing *outside of whatever our tool can help them with*. It was really pleasant, and these were my main take-aways: * I got to put a face to a previously anonymous user. And not only this one person, but thinking back on previous chats I've had, I can kind of extrapolate and now envision what drives a large portion of our users. * I built out some context into their lives, pains, desires and motivations. Both in regards to our product and the pain point we solve, as well as more holistically, in terms of what motivates them. Often I get sucked into thinking in terms of product, pain/solution, revenue, etc. but that's not really how my ICP's mind works. They're thinking about their bills, their kid's school, their marriage, their relationship with their boss and their peers, their side-hustle, etc. How can I inject myself into that internal dialogue? * I got a nice little wake-up slap. It's liberating to realize that the tool you're spending 80% of your waking hours thinking about is only on your users' minds about 2% of the week! It's like the adage that people aren't looking at you, thinking about your faux pas earlier that day, judging you... they're just thinking about their own insecurities and judging themselves. * For some reason, I left the call feeling like an 1800s village butcher/baker. I could see a line of customers outside, recognizing each one by name, knowing their family stories, asking about their kids' exams, etc. And it warmed me up. That's why I got into this, to help real people. Not to write PRDs that may or may not tweak some metric by 0.02%. I think it'd be good for everyone on the team to do this at least once a month, if not once a week. Just a 15-20 minute chat with a user. To realize it's not just analytics and stats, revenue and churn, features, PLG, conversions, etc. That there are regular people out there who just so happened to sign up to your product/service, living regular lives, and you've inserted yourself into them.

The agreement they sent over is structured as right-to-purchase not obligation-to-purchase. The cynic in me says this’ll just prevent me from selling for the next 18 months while something else is going on behind the scenes. I prodded a little bit and heard that this is to clean up the cap table, and have a friend who was bought out as well who says she was given the same reason. Beyond us two, I’m not sure who all was given this agreement. My head is spinning a little, as I was just an early hire - not a cofounder or angel or anything with preferred shares, so far as I know. There’s probably context I’m forgetting to add, but hopefully there’s enough info here to maybe inform on what options I have? My questions are: 1. Do they even have to offer a buyout? They have right of first refusal if I were to list the shares on a PEX or sell to a 3rd party. 2. Assuming they don’t have to offer a buyout, do they anticipate reallocating my shares to new hires? I have 0.05%, which has probably since been diluted. What could they want with these shares? 3. I have a greater desire for short term cash than a long term equity event. I have a new project that is spinning up and would rather allocate cash from a buyout to living expenses now and potentially reap a founding share of this new venture than waiting years for a possible equity event. With that context, how would I go about finding a 3rd party to try and sell to? Are there general rules around sharing the equity agreement with a 3rd party in order to help pitch a deal (specifically the per share price and timeline)? 4. What the hell am I doing. What are _they_ doing? What does it mean that a company is offering a buyback besides “we think this will be worth more later and we want a discount in the short term” - again the cynic in me thinks this isn’t out of the goodness of their hearts.

So here's my question to other founders: Did you start marketing before your product was polished, or wait until it was more refined? How did you know when your MVP was ""good enough"" to spend on ads or marketing? Any tips on attempting to balance product refinement and early growth, considering the limitations of marketing spending?

1oi0igv,2025-10-28T04:42:58,startups,"[i will not promote] OSS startup ecosystems create paid enterprise features, not their ecosystems. Why?","I notice plenty of open source startups create enterprise features, from databases like Elasticsearch/Redis (plus the dumb licensing fiasco) to basic software like an OSS full stack ChatGPT alternative like LibreChat/OpenWebUI or Sentry.io. My question is: if these OSS startups create paid enterprise features, why doesn't the ecosystem of such startups create alternatives that are better priced? Two current theories is: - The ownership of the software lies with the startup. The startup doesn't need to consult with their ecosystem of paid plugins when making breaking changes or they can block plugins to core modules entirely. - Actually adding requested features of code may require fundamental changes to the code that the startup doesn't have to accept because, well, why bother when the startup can force users to pay for their enterprise feature. The point of OSS startups being open source in the first place is to bring in contributors, but I feel like most of these startups do 99% of the coding, hence Sentry.io moving to a BSL license. And secondly, there's a mental model that OSS means you can take the code and roll with it yourself. That's great, but, in reality, once something becomes unmaintained, people move off to a maintained, even paid, closed source, version. So what's the point of open source startup investments?

As it wasn't our main value added step and was non-essential to manufacturing, we wanted to find a vendor that could provide a solution without a lot of legwork in design and installation. We found what we thought was a reputable vendor (not many in terms of this specific equipment to chose from) and went ahead. One year later: design issues from the start that only came to light once 50% charged where engineering blatantly lied about what was promised, delayed procurement and shipping, incorrect/missing parts shipped, a more involved installment than promised, and to top it all off it didn't function appropriately. To add insult to injury, the engineer and main source of contact has completely ghosted us and throws sales managers at us to blame us for the issues and deal with any questions/complaints we have. At this point we've outgrown the need for the equipment, revamped our vendor vetting/procurement process, and due to the way they are treating us and recent comms I doubt refunding is a real option.

(I will not promote)","I was recruited by a Venture Studio to be the CEO of a pre-product SaaS startup and lead it to market. I would love to hear your feedback and tips on my plan for early team hires, working with a dev agency, and growth strategy. We have 2 three-month pilot facilities lined up, each with signed agreements to obtain about a point of equity if they advance past pilot phase and become a customer. Each pilot has the room for expansion within their corporate umbrella. We will be taking a lot of their existing workflow and knowledge that’s currently on paper, digitizing it, and making the edit and approval flow quick and painless. This will help these facilities and their staff operate much more efficiently, will reduce waste, and ensure that everyone is working with the same accurate information. The Venture Studio has committed $400k to develop the MVP and an additional $300k post pilot. We will be working with a Dev Agency (design + engineering) with an initial build timeline of 3 months (I’m sure it will take longer). If successful and needed, we’d seek a Seed Round, but prefer to keep funding minimal. I have an SME co-founder who can only commit 25% of his time. We each have experience starting and exiting SaaS startups in this general industry. My first step is to go deep on the problem and spend a lot of time talking and surveying others. They have already done a lot of work here but I need to go through the process myself. This will help me define a narrow MVP feature set. My first hire will be an **Account Manager** type person who has worked in these environments as a staff member. They will help me onboard these pilot facilities and will spend a lot of time at the facilities working with staff to understand how they are using the product, what’s working, and what’s not. We will then funnel all this back to the Dev Agency for bug fixes, improvements, and any changes that are absolutely necessary. I will also be adding a **commission based sales person** to begin seeding sales at some point early on. I will handle marketing myself as that is in my wheelhouse too. My next hire I plan to either be a **Product Manager or someone with Engineering experience**. Eventually growing our in-house product team when appropriate. As I am a non-technical co-founder, this is perhaps my biggest blind spot. The product will sell for about $7,500/mo per facility. We are not seeking to become a unicorn, rather build a lean, targeted, efficient company that doesn’t get too far ahead of ourselves and remains laser focused on achieving product-market fit, happy early customers, with good data architecture.

Some people swear by their cards, others say they're trash, and I'm just here trying not to mess this up. **Questions:** 1. Should I even bother with a ""business"" card at my scale or just get a personal card with good rewards? 2. Any cards that are actually startup-friendly without needing 5 years of financials? 3.

Meanwhile, their product sits there collecting digital dust because ""we'll scale after we raise our seed round."" Here's the thing - revenue is the only validation that matters. A customer paying you money is a better signal than any investor meeting. It proves someone actually wants what you're building, not just that you're good at storytelling. The VC-first playbook works for maybe 1% of startups. The rest of you are giving away equity and control before you even know if your business model works. You're optimizing for the wrong metric. I'm not saying never raise money. I'm saying earn the right to raise money by proving you have something worth scaling. Build a product people pay for. Get to $10K MRR. Then investors will actually *want* to give you money, and you'll negotiate from a position of strength instead of desperation. But sure, keep rewriting that executive summary.

1og373h,2025-10-25T21:28:51,startups,Exploring a human-verification service for creative work (artists worried about AI vs human authenticity). I will not promote.,"Hi! I'm one of 5 engineers working on a startup idea (still pre-LLC, we're just operating under a ""Founders Agreement"") around helping creators prove their work was made by human and not by AI (or at least majority of the work was done by a human). The idea came to me earlier this month after watching a video from Kurgasagt about how AI slop is killing their channel - mostly because the signal to noise ratio between human-made and AI-slop is getting out of hand on YouTube. My wife, who is a digital artist, has been really frustrated too about how AI takes such little effort vs. her taking weeks to months to make something that takes AI a few minutes to spit out. This feeling permeated art communities pretty deeply from even the most casual observer's perspective. So, in the past few weeks I made a system where creators can share their work along with proof-of-process evidence (i.e. WIP screenshots, layers, timelapse, articles dated before AI got ""good"") and then receive a badge + verification page for their submitted work (assuming it passed human inspection). Additional, we have a gallery system, a portfolio system and an early community hub system to establish a community around ""human made stuff."" We're at the point in development where we are about to open a invite-only Alpha on October 29th. I would love any feedback about a few points: \- Does this problem feel real and significant to you too? Would you care about being able to see something have a ""human verified"" validation? \- From an operations standpoint, how would you scale the human review cost-effectively? We're thinking about paid and community-driven verification systems, as well as integrating AI-assist to help filter out the super obvious AI slop (a little ironic, I know). \- If you were picking your first creator segment (i.e. visual art, traditions art, 3D models, music, audio, writing or interactive media like games), which would you target first? We've already built the system to accept all those segments mentioned, btw. We're bootstrapping this and focusing purely on the value creation rather than growth hacking. I'm also personally invested because my wife is an artist and this all sucks for her too. We all still have our day jobs, so this is something we're building on the side to see how things go - and if they go well, then we can consider actually forming an LLC or something.

So people make surveys. Ask 10 people if they’d buy. If 5 say yes, they call it validation. That never worked for me. I know it’s just about conversations. Conversations have the insights. I figured out my first product by selling phone calls. I didn’t have an offer. No website. No deck. Just a simple message: “I can help you with that. Want to jump on a call?” People paid me to talk. On those calls, I asked questions, got insights, and helped them move forward. That’s it. That’s how the first version of my product was born. It started as research, but it became revenue. I got paid to learn what people actually wanted. After about 20 calls, I saw patterns. Everyone was stuck on the same things. So I turned those conversations into a system. That system became my first real offer. I ended up doing over 400 calls last year. No survey. No validation spreadsheet. Just getting paid to ask and answer real problems. Most people waste months chasing validation. You don’t need approval. You need feedback from someone who’s paid to be there. If they’ll pay to talk, they’ll probably pay for the solution. If they won’t pay to talk, they definitely won’t pay to use it. Don’t hide behind a survey. Speak to more people.

1og2jn8,2025-10-25T21:01:02,startups,Is my idea worth pursuing after a failed ad campaign? (i will not promote),"So I came up with an idea for a mobile analytics-like SDK (won't write the name or website to avoid any promo issues) that allows users to use natural language or drag-and-drop to define trackable events in their dashboard. The idea is that as a user, you only need to initialize the SDK in the app, and then it will do its “magic” to allow for the dashboard functionality. As a mobile developer myself, I noticed how long one single extra event would take to be implemented due to planning → management → task being realized → implementation → release. This solution, however, would give you virtually 0 downtime on getting new events in your dashboard. So I decided to run two ad campaigns here on Reddit since it has a large portion of my target audience (developers, PMs, founders, solo devs, etc.) but here are the results so far: |Amount Spent|Impressions|Clicks|CPC|CTR| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| || |||||| |66 euros|\~34K|257|0.26 euros|0.749%| Total signups via the website's waitlist: 11! Those 11 signups also came from my first campaign, which by mistake was targeting the whole globe, which in turn leads to these signups coming from “poorer” countries. The numbers in the table correspond to the second campaign targeting European countries instead. What should my approach be going forward? Do the low conversions of those 257 clicks mean that the idea isn't worth pursuing? Should I try to instead do some cold outreach and see if anything sticks? Would love to hear your thoughts on this.

1og0idv,2025-10-25T19:36:01,startups,"Started as PM, now I’m closing in on COO/founder-adjacent. Am I underpaid? I will not promote.","Would love some outside perspective on this. I joined a startup about 6 months ago as a project manager. One of the co-founders is a very good high school friend of mine and trusted my experience in project management and just my overall intelligence and work ethic. Originally, I was working west coast hours, starting at 9 AM PST, which was fine at first. But as I got more involved, I started shifting earlier, like 7:30 AM PST, to match the team’s rhythm (this was their request). Eventually, my friend asked if I’d move to the east coast to be fully aligned with their time zone. I agreed. I was planning to move to NYC (and pay my own rent), but then he pushed for me to come to Miami (where he lives) and generously offered to cover my rent + some other costs, which he’s done (I am living in Miami with him now). Now, six months in, my role has completely expanded. I still do PM work, but also: * Creative direction * Product strategy * Operations * Cross-team execution * Random fire-fighting and startup chaos control Basically, I’m the #3 person in the company behind the two co-founders. I’m not a founder, but I’m in the room for everything that matters. I don’t work directly with streamers or players as much as the other founders, but I’m involved in almost everything else that moves the company forward. We’re a profitable, 1.5-year-old startup based in Malta, doing $3M in profit annually. Half the team is US-based, the other half is European devs/designers/support, so we benefit from lower costs there. When I joined, we were doing \~$30–50K/month in profit. Now we're consistently at $250–300K/month, and just hit $1M profit in a single month for the first time. Here’s my current comp: * $6,000/month * 20% annual bonus (performance-based) * No equity * Rent paid in Miami (co-founder’s offer, since he wanted me based there) * \~50 hours/week average. Not high stress though. Co-founders are never like breathing down my neck crazy or make me feel subordinate. All my feedback internally has been really positive, one of the co-founders even said hiring me was one of the best decisions they’ve made for the company. At the time, $6K/month was reasonable. But now they’re asking me to sign a formal contract locking that in, and I’m wondering if it’s outdated, especially since we had previously talked about revisiting comp in January. So here’s where I’m at. Do I: * Stay at $6k/month because I'm still young at the company? * Push for something closer to industry standard? From what I'm seeing and from friends I am hearing that would be $10-15k range. * Ask for equity or a profit-share given my role? I’m 27 with 3 years of PM experience before this, but this role is bigger than anything I’ve done before. I’m not saying I’m the reason for all the growth, but I've provided a lot of value for the company. I just want to make sure I’m being realistic and fair to myself and the company.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1og0idv/started_as_pm_now_im_closing_in_on/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1og026g,2025-10-25T19:17:26,startups,Some advice on recruitment I got [I will not promote],"I recently got some advice on recruitment for early startups that I thought was interesting, so I thought I'd share it here. First of all, he divided the labour market into two types of people, with 3 levels of risk: 1. Those who want to be paid market rate for their skills, he called these people ""traders"" Risk level 3: consultant Risk level 2: changes job every 2 years Risk level 1: stays at the same employer for a long time 2. Those who are willing to invest their skills in order to get a 10X in the future, sacrificing short term market rate pay for long term ROI, he called these people ""entrepreneurs"" Risk level 3: founders Risk level 2: early employees of startups Risk level 3: late employees of startups, but they are still attracted to equity and stock options Now, he said one common mistake for startups is trying to hire traders too early. One way of doing that is to copy a job description from a large corporation and then use that when trying to recruit for your own startup. He said that's dumb, and that you only have two jobs in an early startup - builder and seller. You should only look for, and recruit, a builder or a seller. Even by having a long job description you are going to attract traders. He also said that you should use entrepreneurs for any problem that isn't actually solved yet, when you don't actually know the best way to do it etc. The sale strategy/commercialization strategy is still being built and you need an entrepreneur for that. Once you have figured out how tasks should be done, you should have a trader. He said another common mistake that startups make is when they look for someone with 5 years experience, and realize they can't afford to attract that talent, is that they look for someone with 2-3 years experience instead. The correct solution is to look for someone with 15-20 years experience. Senior/experienced people probably have enough money in the bank to be able and willing to work for equity and think about long term gains rather than actually needing their current market rate to survive, which younger people do. Now, an early startup needs everyone to belong to the entrepreneur group. How to find them? He gave the following advice: * Keep track of other startups, many fail, it's easy to keep track of when they're about to run out of money. Take staff from those companies. * When startups are doing series A investment and are obviously expanding and recruiting more people, it's actually a good time to recruit from them. This is because they now have staff that joined that startup in the early stages, their cliff from that equity is gone and that organization now has a need for traders, so those skills from their early hires are better suited at your early stage startup. * When you see companies hiring new leadership/management, it's a good time to try to recruit people below that manager. Then, he said what to actually do: Track them down on LinkedIn. Traders have good information and a professional picture...",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1og026g/some_advice_on_recruitment_i_got_i_will_not/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1ofgli2,2025-10-25T02:45:21,startups,How Agentic UI Helped Us Win Our First Paying Users. I will not promote,"I want to tell you about a recent MVP build. It started as a regular dashboard with sidebar, multiple buttons, context menus, summary cards, charts... the boring stuff. Seeing the AI-browser trend made something click, and we decided to go on a totally different direction (for the better). That decision turned out to be a great way to win our first paying users. So, we started this build with a sidebar based dashboard. Nothing impactful. If felt just like every other SEO tool in the market. Let's be honest: **Users DON'T WANT to learn a whole new dashboard.** Imagine waking up and thinking: *""Great, I get to spend the whole morning navigating menus and features to figure out this new product.""* It's less cruel to put sugar in your coffee. And at least that doesn't come with a stripe paywall. With AI-browsers becoming the norm, no one has the time or energy for complex interfaces. And in today's fast moving environment, you worry about users abandoning your idea, or competitors getting ahead. So, as much as I hate rework. We had no choice. We rebuilt the entire frontend. And yes, we vibe-coded some of it (I know...). Don't worry, we used safety guards to move faster without risking it looking unpolished to early adopters. (or worse, investors) Here’s what worked: We focused on the one or two decisions that matter most per flow. Instead of: *Go to websites > Fill out website settings > confirm > Go to articles > menu > create article > fill out settings > schedule > confirm.* We chose a simple ""in your face"" approach. 1. Inform your website 2. Click ""generate article"" 3. Go drink your terrible sugared coffee You may think that's stupid, Maybe users will feel stupid. And that's the goal. An MVP should be so simple that it's *stupidly inevitable* to use. In this new version, Motion and micro-interactions became a part of the core user experience. Result: 10+ active subscriptions immediately after launch. Takeaway: An MVP ideally solves a single problem, that works wonderfully with agentic interfaces. No reinventing the wheel, but simply leverage what users want, and make it impossible NOT use your product. Ever thought about running your product like this?

I will not promote,"I guess I have two versions of this question, one geared towards angel investors and one for VCs. Long story short, I was an early hire at a company that’s now come a long way and are doing well. I was part of the team during a few big raises, and know a few names and have possible recognition with some potential sources of funding by nature of being there, but I don’t want to reach out and put my next venture at risk. If I know a guy who was a significant Angel investor for Company A while I was there, is it bad form to reach out and pitch for a slightly similar product? (The product does have some overlap, but will not be a direct competitor to Company A. It’s in a market they’re in but not a vertical they’re targeting - they have two other verticals but missed this one early on. They are capable of creating a competing product to release into their user base faster than I can scale up my existing user base, undercutting this current venture, hence my apprehension) What about for VCs? The VC who led the pre-seed for company A would also be perfect for this new venture, but I don’t want to alert Company A. Possibly the most important caveat in this whole ordeal is that I still have shares in Company A and don’t want any conflict of interest to arise. I can release them but I’d rather get some cash for them. Would exchanging these to an existing Company A investor for a fee and term sheet be possible?

Eight hours feels like nothing. Your body is just broken from the stress. You'll isolate because it feels easier than pretending everything's fine. Simple decisions become impossible.

[I will not promote],"Hi I created a SaaS product for restaurants, cafés and takeaways. It is a custom website CMS for restaurants, similar to what Foodhub offers to their customers: white-label website for a restaurant with online ordering (Stripe handles payments), table bookings, QR Code tableside ordering etc. I have an MVP and validated the idea with 3 business owners (they are my clients who have been successfully taking advantage of the product since August 2025). They have been very happy so far. Unlike competitors, I offer very low commission on each order (2% inc. Stripe fees), however there is a fixed monthly rental fee for the website. Before creating my product, I analysed the market and made a list of disadvantages my competitors have and built the system with these issues in my mind. **So far, what I've got:** 1. Very fast website (unlike Foodhub) 2. Website that can be unique in a way that it will serve customer's brand: custom colours, fonts (CSS overall); home page, etc 3. Table reservations with optional deposit 4. Fully customisable, flexible menu: the restaurant can set up 'modifiers' such as extras on pizza, additional spices, free drink of choice etc 5. Very simple and fast ordering process 6. Accessibility features 7. Almost full control over the website through Settings 8. Advanced SEO with dynamic FAQ 9. Straight-forward QR Code Tableside ordering 10. Scheduled orders 11. Operating hours control for different services (separate for delivery, collection and dine-in) 12. Reviews for verified orders with automatic profanity filter 13. Automated follow-up emails 14. Order tracking 15. Calories display 16. Order printing (if printer is connected to a PC) 17. Timed menus (menus that are available only during specific hours and/or days) 18. Holidays (days when the restaurant is closed - no matter of working hours) 19. API for developers (currently undocumented) ... and more. **What is planned:** 1. POS support. Currently the system is supposed to be used on a computer, tablet or phone. When the website dashboard is open in browser, the website makes a sound on new orders and reservations. 2. Advanced analytics build-in on the website 3. Labels for dishes: vegetarian, vegan, spicy, gluten free, allergens etc 4. Dish picture uploading (currently pictures work through direct link to Imgur picture) 5. More customisability options that can make each restaurant website look more unique 6. Recruiting page where restaurants can advertise their vacancies \------------ The thing is I am a developer, not a salesperson. And while I believe I created a great product which I want to make even better, I need someone who can do sales - because I can't see myself walking from door to door offering my product.

That's not super helpful when you're in the thick of it. Here's a more practical framework: **Think of PMF as a spectrum from 0-100:** **0-25: You have a solution looking for a problem** * You're pitching hard to get people to try it * Users don't come back after first session * You're explaining why they need this **25-50: You have early validation** * A few customers genuinely get value * Some organic word-of-mouth starting * Retention exists but it's fragile * You're still doing most of the heavy lifting **50-75: You're onto something** * Customers are asking for more features * People are renewing/staying without much nudging * You're hearing ""where have you been all my life?"" * Referrals happen naturally **75-100: Strong PMF** * Inbound interest without marketing * Users revolt when features break * High retention rates (70%+ for B2B SaaS) * Growth feels easier than it should **Where most founders get stuck: 25-50 range** You have some success, so you start scaling marketing or building more features. But the foundation isn't solid enough yet. Instead: 1. **Talk to your best 5-10 customers obsessively** \- What would make them 10x more likely to recommend you? 2. **Identify the ""aha moment""** \- What specific action correlates with users who stick around? 3. **Double down on one segment** \- Stop trying to be everything to everyone. Pick your best-fit customers and go deep. 4. **Measure these numbers:** * How many users return within 7 days? * What % complete your core action more than once? * How many unprompted referrals do you get?

Had to shut down, rotate all API keys (costing $$$), migrate everything. The founder lost money on the hack, so much time, credibility with the client and trust in the process. Here's the thing: Would you send a contract to a client without reading it, just because AI wrote it? Would you send an investor pitch without knowing what it says? Of course not. So why would you run your entire technical infrastructure on code you can't read? AI amplifies what you already know. If you understand business, AI makes you better at business. If you know code, AI makes you code 10x faster. But if you know nothing about code and try to build a tech product with just prompts, you're not in control of your own company. The new reality post-AI: You don't need 10 developers anymore. You need 1-3 people who REALLY know their domain, amplified by AI. That's more powerful than 20 people without AI.

I spent countless hours learning, building, breaking things, and slowly mastered it. At one point, my goal was clear: work at a FAANG company and become a top-tier engineer. But something changed. While working, I started watching YC talks, reading founder stories, and realized I was more fascinated by how people build companies and solve problems rather than just writing code. I stopped chasing “good ideas” and started looking for real problems to solve. That’s when the entrepreneurship bug bit me hard. Since then, I’ve been working with small startups, helping them build products from scratch, solving niche technical problems, and learning to wear multiple hats. But recently, I took a break completely paused everything for a month and now I’m stuck in this weird space. I’m questioning whether I’m still the right fit for a “technical role.” I can build things, I am a fast learner, and I can jump between languages or frameworks easily… but deep down, I just want to build my own products. Now I’m at this crossroad I need money, but I’m not sure if applying for full-time technical jobs is the right move anymore.

Recently, one of their competitors also joined and started adding similar events. The original community wasn’t happy and said they’d leave unless I removed the competitors. They’re also on a lower commission rate, 1.5% instead of the standard 3% ,because they supported us early. They feel that since they helped us grow, they should get some protection or exclusivity. I tried asking them to wait until the weekend to see how things play out, but they didn’t want to. One of them even said I’d lied to them and what i have promised that we wouldn’t send notifications for similar events to their audience directly, not that we’d block others entirely. To calm things down, I compromised, I’ve limited visibility for the new competitor’s events so they’re only accessible through direct links if shared. I haven’t deleted them, but they’re not publicly visible for now. Now I’m torn. I want to stay fair and open as a platform, but I also don’t want to lose the communities that helped us get traction in the first place. If you were in my shoes, what would you do?

Also I will not promote.","Hey everyone, About six months ago I started working on a **Voice AI storytelling tool for solo tabletop RPG players.** Early feedback was awesome. People had fun breaking AI Game Master, some replayed multiple times and my local (Polish) RPG community seemed to like it. I kept iterating, releasing updates, gathering feedback - it felt like things were moving in the right direction. But after a few months, I hit a few big roadblocks: 1. **Funding** \- I couldn’t get any investors interested - it looks like I would need to have huge audience and paying customers 2. **Community backlash** \- When I shared it on reddit rpg promo subreddit, people *hated* it. Like, genuinely angry - saying AI ruins creativity and the planet (even though I wrote all the adventures myself). 3. **Traction** \- Despite having solid features, players didn’t really stick around treating it more like ""a fun novelty to try once"". I had two paying users, but I wasn't sure how to find more. 4. **Competition** \- One well-funded competitor has already taken the market spotlight. In addition I keep seeing a flood of smaller (often low-quality, vibe coded) copycats which keeps appearing making it even harder to stand out. 5. **Pricing** \- Voice AI pricing model is tricky - making it real time and based on ElevenLabs makes it much more expensive compared to traditional games (think Baldur's Gate will give you hundred of hours for less). Also with all this AI bubble I'm thinking making it sustainable in the future in B2C market might be impossible. Now I’m at a crossroads. I had to take a job to pay the bills and I’m wondering if I should **pivot or shut down the project.** I'm sort o lost if there’s something worth salvaging here. Has anyone been in a similar spot? I know in the hindsight that maybe I should have validated before better, but this is my first time being a founder.

The idea emerged when I found a competitor working on the same idea ( building in public ) which validated the demand. I posted about the idea, demo video from figma and asked bunch of people about their opinion when starting in order to make sure I have a ""wishlist"" of people who would buy the product once the beta would be built. Back at this this I was decent in programming and the problem I was solving was technically very challenging, and I had to spent a lot of time learning about the tech in order to develop the software. The competitor was developing their product for ""macOs"" systems and I decided to develop specifically for chrome extension in order to differentiate myself ( as I couldn't afford a macbook back than ), after months of tries and errors I finally made the product and launched on product hunt without any following anywhere and got 500+ upvotes on PH which helped me lot, got 4k signed up users and 200 + paid users which validated the idea. However, later things started to get serious, the chrome has lots of restrictions and the product is not good as a browser tool, and I told all the users ( which they requested as well ) that I would be developing a macOs version ( like the competitor ) in the future. MacOs is the perfect platform for this app. After months of months of following the competitor daily and their journey, its clear that they had captured a huge market by this point, their company twitter page has 30k followers and companies like OpenAI, Google, Figma uses their product, making about \~ $3Million / year which really demotivates me as I think I had lost the game. According to them, they are a team of 8 full time employees and growing. After my own launch on product hunt, I bought a macbook and started learning apple development, however I faced a lot of health issues during this time, anxieties and was off from the product for months without giving any updates ( I am angry on myself for this ). Even today, I don't do any marketing for my chrome extension, but still gets traffic and sometimes paid users ( even with a bad product ). During this time, I worked on few different IOS apps as a side quest nothing fancy and planned about starting something new in AI or any other industry. I have some good ideas on making the macOs app better than the competitor and new design philosophy as last time people had really appreciated my design calling it ( ""The best design they have seen"" )I am still 30% done with the macOs app, and I still work on it full time ( sometime ), but also spends days thinking I doing it wrong and should be focusing on something else ( as everyone is starting ""AI startups and I might miss both the trains ).

He told me it would take about a month to build the MVP, so I expected to receive it by early June. In reality, it took four months - I only received the code around September. While the development was ongoing, I asked a friend (paid) to create a landing page for our app so we could start collecting emails. He did it quite quickly. Since the original developer wasn’t delivering on time, I offered my friend a sort of CTO position to take over development. The main developer is a great guy with strong coding skills, but I can’t stand when someone says something will take a certain amount of time and then delivers four times slower. In the end, my friend declined the CTO offer, so I posted a job ad on LinkedIn and received a lot of applications. I decided to go with a guy who works as a tech lead and had built a side product for a company that later became a unicorn - a great find. My goal from the start was to have a coder who could grow into the CTO role. He’s very knowledgeable, but after a few weeks, he realized he didn’t have enough time. He agreed to stay on as a consultant but not do any coding himself. So, my friend who built the landing page decided to take over development because he saw the potential. About a month ago, he took charge, reviewed everything, fixed a lot of the code (though not all of it), and did an amazing job. But now, with the busy weeks before Black Friday, there’s been almost no progress on the coding side. At the same time, I’m in talks with several investors who want updates - but we still can’t release the product publicly because it’s too buggy. I’m stuck in this position where I can’t just hire a new developer, since my financial situation is tight after quitting my main job. And development is moving too slowly for us to create real buzz around the product. People really like my pitch, the product idea, and the design, but investors won’t commit without a tested version. We will start testing the concept without the actual product, which is a good initiative, but it’s frustrating how long everything takes. We already combined a team of six people and they are ready to contribute in different areas, but without a working product, we can’t really start our business development efforts. To be clear - none of the three developers are bad people. They’re all knowledgeable and great to talk to and I would definitely drink beers with them. But the delays and time management issues are wearing me down.

1obeyqo,2025-10-20T08:51:30,startups,Launch Lessons I've Learnt So Far (I Will Not Promote),"Hey, TL;DR - Launch early. Launch often. I've launched 5 web apps now and every time I launch I learn. Here's a breakdown of the mistakes and what I now know. 1) You don’t need everything perfect. You need momentum. With my first launch, I tried to make sure all my ducks were aligned. Now, I just make sure the main pillars are in place then I go with it. 2) Every launch gives you feedback. Never even thought about this with my first or even second launch. With each launch, you learn what resonates, what flops, who actually cares, and where your audience hangs out. 3) The reality is, most people overthink launch timing. I followed all the rules e.g. launch Midnight eastern on Monday to maximise the launch window, avoid launching when big guns .e Apple, Tesla, OpenAI etc launch stuff. Nobody remembers your first version anyway. 4) You'll likely have to launch the same thing multiple times. There's no launch and it's done. Look at the most successful products of all time - Coca Cola, Windows, iPhone, Porsche 911 etc. They relaunch the same thing over and over again but better. That's where you want to be. 5) Build a community. Easier said than done for sure but if you have \*some\* community it will help, even with as simple things as launch feedback let alone spreading the word. I thought cause I had 15k across all socials that was enough. Reality is you'd be better off with 15 hardcore friends and fans than 15k of people that aren't engaged. Start building a community now. Hope this helps with your launch.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1obeyqo/launch_lessons_ive_learnt_so_far_i_will_not/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1obcos0,2025-10-20T06:30:53,startups,Figuring our pivot strategy (i will not promote),"Last year, my friend and I set out to build a startup in the thrift and vintage space. After extensive market research, we landed on the idea of creating an AI-powered cross-listing platform for thrift stores, a tool designed to automate posting inventory across multiple resale platforms. We joined several incubators + a VC fellowship, built and launched the product, tested it with early customers, and went through a full sales cycle. Although we didn’t secure investment or achieve VC-level traction, the experience gave us valuable insights into the space. Through working with customers, we discovered that many of the operational challenges faced by thrift stores mirror those in broader retail, including inventory management, multi-channel sales, data fragmentation, and workflow inefficiencies. That realization has shaped our next chapter: building a “Retail OS,” a unified system to power modern retail operations. We’re currently piloting our solution with a mid-sized retail vintage chain that operates three locations, testing several of the core features we envision for the platform. However, our new challenge is moving upmarket. Selling to retailers involves longer sales cycles, and decision-makers at mid-sized stores are harder to reach. Some advisors have suggested we position the product as an ERP, but we’re hesitant because the term often implies enterprise-grade complexity and large development teams, which doesn’t align with our lean, modular approach. We’ve also explored building a POS component, but we believe the world doesn’t need yet another POS system. Our main questions now are: 1. How can we effectively sell to retail organizations given their slower decision cycles and harder-to-reach stakeholders? 2. How should we frame our product, as an ERP, OS, or something else, to resonate with both smaller shops and larger retail players? We’ve gathered deep insights from smaller stores and their pain points, but to scale effectively, we need to better understand the challenges and priorities of larger retailers.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1obcos0/figuring_our_pivot_strategy_i_will_not_promote/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1obcbml,2025-10-20T06:07:31,startups,"If you are about to start up, these uncomfortable truths might save you a lot of trouble [I will not promote]","Recently I saw a few posts on Reddit about the struggle with cofounders, so I thought I'd try to make a wake-up call. I've made these mistakes myself, and I see it too often in teams I work with. 1.: You need one true leader. Ofc, the best case is when everyone is able to solve problems on their own without approval. But let's face it. Disagreements are inevitable. A lot of teams seem to try a team of executives with equal voting power. I did too and in return, I’ve lost countless weeks to unresolved debates. If no one is empowered to break a deadlock, you’ll burn through energy and time – both of which you can’t afford to waste. In a perfect world, consensus or voting would lead to the best outcomes. But in reality, that only leads to a compromise that no one is happy with. Instead, you need one decision-maker to ensure speed and direction. Someone with both the authority to overrule and the wisdom to know when to use it. 2.: Cofounder alignment must be 100% Obviously, the team needs to share a vision of the product. But that’s not enough. Equally important is WHY each person is doing this entrepreneur thing. In my view, the only valid reason to work in innovation is because you genuinely want the problem solved. That mission needs to be your main motivation – and beware: people often deceive themselves (and others) about this. Work styles also matter. If one cofounder sacrifices every second, and another is aiming for work-life balance, resentment is inevitable. Even small misalignments will derail progress over time by making the workhorse feel used. That'll lead to burnout or demotivation. Don't underestimate how much strain founding can be for your family. I know founders who broke because they could not care for their business and their child at the same time, even though they tried hard. Successful startups aren't built by individuals hustling in different directions - they're built on synchronized efforts. 3.: Experience won’t get you there It doesn’t matter what degrees you hold or what jobs you’ve had. In true innovation, you’ll need to learn something new every single week. If a team member isn’t naturally curious and able to adapt quickly, they’ll struggle. In fact, traditional corporate experience can be a disadvantage. For example: Conventional project management often fails spectacularly in startup or innovation contexts. 4.: Don’t build remotely I’ve tried to build businesses fully remote – and I wouldn’t do it again. Yes, I am far more productive at home, and many highly motivated people are too. But building a business or complex product is more about collaboration than individual productivity. It’s rare to find a team where everyone is both a digital native and a communication expert – which is what remote-first truly requires. Remote teamwork is a skill – and few actually possess it. (all that I know spent their entire youth in gaming clans, lol) As much as I dislike admitting it: In-person work is a good idea.

1ob7m98,2025-10-20T01:56:48,startups,Is my idea any good? (I will not promote),"This idea just popped into my head today, and I’ve been thinking about it for a while. Basically, there are tons of viral tweets on X (Twitter). According to Grok, around 85% of them come from random personal accounts, not influencers or brands. Many of these tweets get anywhere from 100K to over 10 million views. I’ve noticed that a lot of these users end up replying to their own viral tweets, sometimes to promote something of their own , and other times just posting something random because they don’t actually have anything decent to promote. That got me thinking, as a business owner, I’d totally be interested in paying someone to promote my brand or product in a reply under their viral tweet, especially if the post is from someone in my country or niche. Of course the price would depend on the virality and topic of tweet itself. So I thought of a platform, kind of like a marketplace for viral tweets, where you can browse the most viral posts at any moment, filter by country or niche, and place a bid for the creator to promote you in a reply. The platform would take a small commission from each transaction and payments could run globally through Stripe. I think this has big potential. Right now, X doesn’t pay that well for views (it’s kind of a hot topic rn) and plus who wouldn’t mind earning some extra money. And businesses could advertise directly to specific, engaged audiences and X’s user base is growing every day. What do you guys think?

I have seen countless youtube videos, talked to peers, friends, and strangers to find out what can I do or not do to find the one thing that will change my life for better.

1oa457s,2025-10-18T19:00:17,startups,Should I change my app name? (I will not promote).,"I’m going to try to explain this without saying the name of my app for the sake of not promoting. I made an app over four years ago. I showed it off on Reddit a bit and it actually got great feedback but I just didn’t stay consistent in growth and worked on other projects. It’s a Slack app so it exists in the Slack marketplace for anyone to find but again I didn’t promote it for many years. All of a sudden recently, I received an inbound contact from an organization that wants to use the app and it’s looking like a great opportunity for them and me to collaborate. Then today I received a comment on one of my Reddit posts about the app from over four years ago. Here’s why I’m asking this question. It looks like another company started up during that four year span with some real growth funding behind them. They are using [myappname].ai I use [myappname].chat. They seem to be dominating SEO for the name but don’t compete with me as far as solutions go. So, do I change the name as to not collide OR is it possible I’m receiving this seemingly random influx of inbound traffic because people are looking for them? I’ve even received support emails from their customers. Any advice?",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1oa457s/should_i_change_my_app_name_i_will_not_promote/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1o9ystk,2025-10-18T15:29:15,startups,Joined a Series-A startup and it’s chaos. Should I quit or stay? ( I will not promote),"Hey folks, I joined a Series-A startup recently as a tech lead. On paper, the vision sounded amazing. It's a super-flexible platform meant to work for any company, in any industry. The pay is good and the people are nice. But two weeks in, here’s what I’m seeing: 1. Trying to do everything: The founders want to build something that works for everyone, across every possible use case. There’s no clear niche or focus. Just “we’ll handle all kinds of clients.” 2. Product constantly breaking: They trying to bring all in one app. The system works with few demos, but when setup or real customer data is in progress, it breaks. Every new customer is unique in their requirements, and instead of saying no or prioritizing, the team feels compelled to make it bespoke which ruins other parts of the product. 3. Fragile technical foundation: Management is very non-technical. There's constant pressure from sales to ""just make it work."" Many clients pay less than 1000 dollars but every single one demands high-touch service. (Its more VC money than customer revenue) 4. Burnout and team fatigue: There have already been some people who've left. The ones remaining all appear to be exhausted (and annoyed). Most dev work is outsourced to contractors and have 4 or 5 engineers in office. They are aggressively hiring without any plan. 5. No actual forward progress: Every week is a new fire drill. New clients come in, something breaks, quick fix, another feature breaks and it goes on. They rely on vibe code shortcuts and one-off hacks, so debugging and ownership are very difficult. I’ve been here barely two weeks, and people are already holding me accountable for issues that have existed for months. So I’m wondering: 1) Is this kind of chaos normal for a Series-A startup? 2) Has anyone ever witnessed a horizontal ""serve-everyone"" product plan come to reality? 3) If you were standing in my position, would you stick around to try to steer it or cut losses early before getting dragged down with it?

They’ve raised under $1M from friends and family and don’t have any customers yet. The team includes a CEO, a small dev team, no CTO or CRO, and a few other advisors. I already have a full-time job. The offer is for 10,000 shares as non-statutory options, vesting 25% each quarter over a year. The tasks listed include attending meetings, giving guidance on client engagement, helping shape frameworks and KPIs, and advising on scaling processes. My concerns are that they mentioned 1–2 hours per week, which feels like a lot; 1–2 hours per month seems more realistic for a purely advisory role. Some of the asks feel more operational or fractional than strategic advisory. The IP clauses are broad, covering work product and pre-existing materials, so I want to make sure my rights are protected. I plan to review everything with HR and an attorney before signing to ensure the role stays advisory-only. Does this equity seem typical for a seed-stage advisor?

Before writing more code, I want to **validate the community layer** to see if people actually want to discuss, share, and reason about their health data together. I’m torn between these paths: 1. Building a small invite-only Discord for athletes, biohackers, and coaches who use Whoop / Oura / Apple Health 2. Creating a Substack-style space where I post “data stories” from real users and have people debate them 3. Starting a public waitlist + early community where testers can get personalized insights.

My parents have been in clothing since the 1980s, so I grew up surrounded by it, but I went into computer science instead, keeping this dream of having my own brand quietly in the background. A couple of years ago, I started researching fashion in depth and was shocked by how much of it is built on greenwashing, “luxury” pieces made of polyester, “sustainable” brands overproducing, and so much disconnect between story and substance. That pushed me to want to do things differently: small-batch, honest, culturally relevant, and truly high quality. I’ve invested around $30K so far, working with a top NYC pattern maker, sourcing premium fabrics, producing samples and a small run of 25 pieces, and shooting a small editorial campaign. I’m now finalizing packaging and building my website myself while slowly starting to post on social media. Before opening pre-orders, I’d love advice from anyone who’s launched a high-end or niche product: - Should I start with a small pop-up or focus online first? - Is PR too early right now? - Any experience working with stylists or influencers when gifting isn’t possible? - Have ads worked for you when targeting a luxury audience?

Recently got access to a rich podcasting dataset (around 170k shows) for an unrelated client project. So I thought why not do some side quests out of curiosity? The first thing I wanted to look at: **how often do the biggest podcasters publish?** I pulled the top 1,000 shows (by audience) from that dataset. Here's what I found: Weekly shows dominate, as expected. But nearly 1 in 5 publish daily (way more than I thought). First I will show the results and then methodology # Results # Visual See image attached post. # Table |Frequency bucket\*|Shows|Share| |:-|:-|:-| |Weekly (3–9 days)|582|58.2%| |Daily (\~1 day)|185|18.5%| |Near Daily (≤3 days)|135|13.5%| |Monthly (10–29 days)|83|8.3%| |Other (>30 days)|15|1.5%| |**Total**|**1,000**|**100%**| \*Frequency buckets explained in the methodology section below. # What Stood Out * **Daily isn't rare.** 185 shows (18.5%) publish every day. That's way more than I expected. Most are newsroom-style shows that act like broadcast desks (NPR's *Up First*, *The Megyn Kelly Show*, *The Glenn Beck Program*). You also get daily scripture feeds like *The Bible in a Year* and sports shows that follow game cycles. Some shows post multiple times per day or break long episodes into clips. * **Weekly dominates.** 582 shows (58.2%) stick to the 3-9 day rhythm. Shows that drop the same day each week (This American Life, Crime Junkie, Radiolab, Revisionist History, Criminal, Hidden Brain, etc.). People know when to expect them. * **Near-daily surprised me.** 135 shows publish every 2-3 days. Most seem to be personality-driven shows. Think *My Favorite Murder*, *Office Ladies*, *Pod Save America*, *Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend*. They're evergreen-ish but reactive. * **Slow can still work, but I'm not sure why.** 98 shows publish monthly or slower and still hit the top 1%. Some look like high-production investigative series (*Dr. Death*) or prestige history shows. But I haven't dug deep enough to know if they're intentionally slow for quality reasons or just have inconsistent schedules. The monthly ones cluster around 14-21 days, the really slow ones can go 36-120 days between episodes. # Methodology Here's how I crunched the numbers: * Started with \~167k shows from the PodSeeker dataset. * Then I sorted by audience size and grabbed the top 1,000 (for anyone interested, that's about 73k+ listeners boundary at that percentile). * For each show, I looked at their RSS feed and pulled up to 40 recent episodes. * Calculated the gaps between publish dates. Used median gaps instead of averages because medians ignore one-off breaks or publishing bursts. * Bucketed the results into frequency buckets: Daily (\~1 day), Near-daily (≤3 days), Weekly (3-9 days), Monthly (10-29 days), Other (>30 days). That's it. Simple enough that anyone can reproduce this. # What's Next This turned out to be way more fun than I expected.

I think hes purposely gaslighting me to avoid promoting me. I've been at my current job for just under two years and I've built an entire ABM program from the ground up with minimal support. Most companies have entire TEAMS dedicated to this but I'm a one man army. I built the strategy, segmentation, and I'm also handling the digital execution on LinkedIn. Im managing about 200k in quarterly spend and driving great efficiency. Long story short, I've exceeded every single goal and target that I've been given. I grew our lead delivery by 136% qoq and also generated nearly 200k in qualified pipeline in Q3 alone. Id say I'm crushing it all things considered. However, any time my manager gives me ""feedback"" on the program its always ambiguous and hypothetical from the perspective of other leaders In our last 1:1 he said the following statements: 1. ""if the CEO asked the head of sales if he would cut your program tomorrow, I'm not sure what he'd say"" 2. ""well the head of sales has never believed in ABM"" 3. ""I just dont know if the value of your program is being perceived"" Um, what? The numbers and data don't lie. I don't see how you can look at our active deal cycles, pipeline generated, and overall lead quality and make those statements. He's also been repeating those 3 points almost word for word for nearly a year. I just find it strange. I have a feeling hes trying to discourage me from asking for a raise and a promotion by lowering my confidence and making me feel uneasy about my work. So what do y'all think? Am I being sensitive or misinterepting what he's saying?

I’m currently working with a pretty unique pre-seed founder who’s building an EU-based multi-cloud platform focused on data sovereignty. The founder’s stance is: no tracking, no third-party cookies, no analytics that invade privacy. It’s fully aligned with the company’s mission around transparency and data protection (which I totally respect) but I’ve never operated in such a *strict* no-tracking setup before. I’ve been asked to find **alternative KPIs** to show conversions and funnel performance without using cookies or tracking tools. Normally, I’d start with top-of-funnel metrics (traffic, outbound, engagement), then connect everything through Salesforce to see conversions. But since this is a pre-seed company, everything’s still manual, and I can’t rely on that. Our current activations include: * Blog and newsletter content * A survey form that gifts a free membership upon completion * LinkedIn outbound outreach **The challenge:** I don’t know which initiative is driving what, and there won’t *ever* be a tracking system. Still, I need to define meaningful KPIs since the founder is preparing for fundraising. Has anyone here tackled privacy-first or zero-tracking attribution before? How did you measure conversion or engagement effectively? Would love any frameworks, creative workarounds, or ways to structure metrics for this kind of setup.

About 3 years ago the head of marketing spun up an internal technical and project management team to help improve the teams efficiency, I was put in charge of that team. We achieved a lot of great things: implementing several new systems and processes that massively increased the teams efficiency and output. Every year I smashed my personal objectives and the team smashed theirs too. Our workload consisted of about 30% BAU (maintaining all the things we had implemented) and then 70% new work pretty much exclusively briefed in by the head of. It worked very well, things ran smoothly, and we were all very happy. About 3 months ago the head of marketing left and the replacement has been a nightmare. She is very disengaged with all the parts of our team. However for our marketing planning and delivery teams this is not a huge issue, as 90% of of their work is BAU, so even without an engaged leader they have a lot to be getting on with. The issue is with my team. Due to the new head of's lack of engagement, the pipeline of new work has all but stopped, which was around 70% of our work, and I am struggling with what to do. I am trying to spin up our own projects, things I think will help the team, but every time I speak with the new head of they seem very unimpressed. I know she is planning a restructure in the not too distant future and I am really concerned about losing my job, which would be a disaster, as my life is moulded around this job, its location, and the flexibilities it brings.

I know this is going to sound like a no-brainer and a first world problem but I recently got offered a job at an independent agency. I currently work at a major agency under one of the big hold cos. For the last year and a half I have been really unhappy with my current role on the agency side. The account was okay but we were just assistants to the client and did no REAL planing/strategy work or investment. My role on this account was recently cut due to account changes and I was finally moved into a new position. Just to set the stage I had asked internally to be moved in December/January and I am only now being moved in October because my role was impacted. I have been very frustrated and fed up with the internal workings of being at a big hold co and not being able to move around easily and waiting so long to get a role change. However, I am finally moved into a programmatic only role that I have been trying to get for the last year and on a new account. I am starting to become happy with my work as I am being challenged in this new role. The downside is this role was a lateral move so I am still stuck at the Senior Associate level after already being one for about 2 years. This new position is on a health/medical account which is something I am not really interested in moving towards based on the verticals I have experienced so far and enjoy. This role is a manager role so it would be a promotion and the salary increase would be a lot and much needed in this economy and in NYC. My gut is telling me to not accept it because I know I will be unhappy with the work and on the client. After just escaping an awful account where I had no growth and no way to measure my skills and success I am not looking to be unhappy again. However my brain is saying due to the promotion and salary increase I should take it. Does anyone have any advice on how to move forward with this situation? tldr: Finally got moved off my awful agency account and into a new role after asking for almost a year. I am excited about my new role but it is a vertical move.

Should I start posting content on this account, or make a new one?","So I'm about to start making content and I'm really excited. My motivation has been at an all-time high. However, I just recently discovered something that is starting to get to me: My initial plan was to start posting on my main Instagram account (personal one) and build it from there. I have about 300 followers just from people I've known throughout my life, and so I thought it'd be easier to build momentum from that rather than start a new account at 0 followers. Plus I wanted everyone to see it and wasn't worried about people on there seeing it etc. What's getting to me is that... when you click on my ""about this account"" section, it says I've changed my username 5 times. Realistically, I've only dramatically changed it once, but there was a month where I changed it 4 times in a row because I was experimenting with different ones to settle on one I liked. At the time, I had no idea it would be public that I changed my account name 5 times, which is why I thought it'd be safe to experiment. It's genuinely so annoying that this is a thing. If it were 3 or less changes then I'd feel fine, but 5? I worry that people will find that suspicious. Let's say I were to gain a following, and people were to notice that - would people grow suspicious of me? Would people think I'm inauthentic etc.? For context, the content I'm posting will have my face in it, so I'm clearly not some faceless bot, but still, this makes me worry. So, what should I do? Option 1: Start on my main account, with the 300 personal followers and the 5 username changes Option 2: Create a completely new account specifically for my content, and without the 5 username changes Please help me decide.

1od7q0b,2025-10-22T13:04:53,marketing,"First time trying to sell a €7M Italian Villa, am I missing something obvious?","Hi everyone, sorry if this sounds a bit random, I’m not a realtor or a real estate expert. I actually work in a small digital agency that just started, and somehow I ended up in charge of promoting a €7 million villa in Italy that needs to be sold in the next few months. So yeah, it’s a bit out of my comfort zone. My current idea is pretty basic: run a Google Search campaign (around 3k€/month, client insisted on it), list the property on JamesEdition.com and Gate-away.com, focus on good visuals, we’re already working on professional photos and videos. No Meta ads for now, and we don’t have a real estate agent involved — it’s just us. The villa is priced at €7M, but the actual valuation is around €12M, so visibility is my main concern. I just want to make sure the right kind of audience sees it, people actually capable and interested, not random clicks. I’m not asking for anyone to build a strategy for me, just curious if these steps sound reasonable or if I’m missing something obvious. Any input from people who have done international property marketing or luxury listings would be really appreciated. Thanks for reading (honestly, I just needed to write this down somewhere and see if it makes sense.)",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1od7q0b/first_time_trying_to_sell_a_7m_italian_villa_am_i/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

Whenever I watch Hulu with ads, sometimes the ads will be “which ad experience do you prefer” or “choose your ad experience” with two ads for the same company/product. There’s usually a timer (in addition to the timer for all of the commercials within one break) for you to select either one, and if you don’t, it selects the first one on the left for you and plays the ad. My question is, is this used for A/B testing? Do the results of how many people select one vs the other become market research? I personally quickly pick whichever one is already selected (path of least resistance) because I want the ad break to be over as fast as possible, and my theory is many other people do this too, meaning there would be a disproportionate number of people select the first ad.

In short, marketing is fucking lonely, senior marketing is brutal.

Each session would be structured around: - Someone presents a real challenge they're facing (campaign review, org problem, strategic decision) - Group works through it together - Maybe keep a running doc of frameworks/insights that come up No deck. No guest speakers. No one trying to sell you anything. Just senior level marketers who've been in the shit. The logistics: - Probably evenings ET to accommodate West Coast - First session would be experimental. if the vibe is off or it's not valuable, no hard feelings - I'd facilitate initially but open to rotating - Expecting this to work only if everyone comes prepared to contribute, not just lurk If this sounds like something you'd actually show up for (not just ""yeah cool idea"" but actually block the time), drop a comment or DM with: - Your current role/industry - One challenge you're dealing with right now that a group like this could help with If I get enough interest from the right folks, I'll set up a poll for timing and we'll try one session.

I work for a small business who designs and sells unique niche gift jewelry. We do sell online-retail direct-to-customer, but we primarily sell to both large and small account Wholesale buyers. One of the hats I wear as a designer is marketing, which is primarily email at this time. Over the last few months, my manager seems to have the idea that our email audience does not read AT ALL. To quote recent feedback, ""You want to write the Odyssey when customers are giving their attention to the cover of Vogue."" For reference, I'm not writing paragraphs here. My email copy is generally tight and concise, I keep body copy under 50 words, and very to-the-point without being mechanical and soulless (brand voice: warm, artistic, friendly, personal.) Any text below the fold is highly structured with headers, lists, bullet points, etc. and is directly related to the image it's next to. My direction is to cut nearly all copy from email and ""let the visuals speak for themselves"", despite the images not really communicating anything beyond ""this is what our products look like."" The impression I get is that, to him, brevity = clarity. I've tried explaining that the ""Cover of Vogue"" analogy isn't an accurate representation of the situation. I outlined the AIDA Marketing Pipeline, and explained that by the time they're receiving emails from us, they've expressed an interest in the brand and want to know more, so I have a little bit more space than the 0.5 seconds or less expected in the ""Attention"" stage. And that images AND copy are important in Email, not just for the technological searchability of email providers, but for clear messaging. (I find it difficult to advertise a sale or market a product when I can't explain what the sale is or anything about the product). Instead of considering any of the points I bring up, he says something like ""We have foundational differences to how we approach marketing and this will not be reconciled with any amount of discussion."" Then I'm directed to apply his changes without further consideration. As a result, I feel like I'm just sending out emails of product photography with zero substance. I'm not allowed to A/B test copy vs. no copy, and every time I've tried to educate based on my own formal education and experience (BFA Graphic Design + independent study and research in the field of Marketing), it's dismissed and I'm told I'm being argumentative.

Even a bit rough around the edges attracts people.* # 2. It Uses the Uncanny Valley of Compliments AI loves to flatter, but it doesn't know *why* it's complimenting you. It often lands on a vague, placeholder phrase that feels manufactured. The phrase: ""I was deeply impressed by your **thought leadership** in the space."" *Thought leadership?* What specific thought? Was it an article, a speech, a tweet? **Last week, I got 14 versions of that exact line in my inbox.** When an email uses a corporate buzzword that could apply to literally any semi-successful person, I know it's a merge field, not a genuine sentiment. # 3. There is No Evidence of Actual Effort or Risk An automated email is built for efficiency—it requires zero input from the sender beyond hitting ""send."" A human email, the kind that actually gets a response, has a subtle trace of effort—a tailored sentence, a customized link, or a deliberate vulnerability (a quick joke, a clear personal opinion). The automated email is **stuck in neutral**, perfectly polished but totally inert. **TL;DR:** If you want a human response, you have to send a human email.

Am I right in smelling something off here? I'm interviewing with a company where the cmo came in a year ago and heavily restructured the marketing function. Some people went, some people stayed. From our initial meeting, cmo certainly seems very strategic and capable. My second round was earlier in the week with one of the team leaders who, from what I can tell, predates cmo. They partially report to cmo and partially to another exec. My hunch is that this was a political decision. During this chat they showed me stuff they were working on...while asking me to keep it secret from cmo, shared strategy opinions that were contrary to what cmo shared, and ultimately just didn't seem aligned with cmo at all. I'm still seeing the process through but like...this is a red flag right? I'm not even in, and I already feel like I've been pulled into some internal political bs. My current company is sort of chaos so I'm really not keen to jump from the pot right into the fire.

I’m sharing these because they’re obvious in hindsight but they’re the ones I never want to forget again. >**FU #1: I didn’t understand the goal of the Design Review** I treated it like a presentation instead of a feedback session. Result: I wasted time on context and left no space for useful discussion. **Lesson:** Know your audience. * Engineers care about feasibility, effort, reuse. * Design leaders care about clarity of vision, usability, accessibility. * Product cares about metrics and desirability. * And always confirm why the session exists before you start. **Tip:** Before every review, ask “What’s the purpose and who’s in the room?” Recommended read: Articulating Design Decisions by Tom Greever. >**FU #2: I fell in love with the first idea** The AI prototyping hype made it quicker but that I skipped proper problem framing and built the wrong thing beautifully. Was told my solution didn't efficiently solve the problem after 5 months down the wrong path when I could've explore better ideas. **Lesson:** * Define the problem before touching Figma or AI tools. * Don’t confuse activity with progress. * Test multiple rough concepts first. * Work with your Product Manager/Owner closely through this phase. **Tip:** Use any of the many prioritisation frameworks to compare ideas before refining one. >**FU #3: I got feedback too late** I waited until I was 80% done and by then, I was too attached to change direction. **Lesson:** * Get feedback at 10%, 50%, and 80% progress. * Present unfinished work bc that’s where the best feedback happens. * Give details on the context, goal, stage, and what feedback you need on. **Tip:** * Use a simple traffic-light system: Green (keep), Amber (consider), Red (change). * Be explicit on what feedback you need on e.g. Content, UI, Interactions, user flow etc. >**FU #4: Don't present like a real estate agent. I showed everything** One giant user flow, 10 entry points, and half-baked ideas = chaos. It looked like the Homer Simpson car of UX. **Lesson:** * Always give a recommended direction. * Focus on the core 80% of the idea. * Cut noise and low-confidence concepts. **Tip:** * Ask yourself: “If they remember one thing from this review, what should it be?” **FU #5: I asked, “Any feedback?”** That’s designer code for “please help me” and it never works. Stakeholders were unsure what exactly to give feedback one given I presented to so much. **Lesson:** Frame your ask around goals or risks. **Tip:** * Your job isn’t just designing for users it’s designing for decision-making. * Point out what type of feedback you need from each person's role. * Watch [Donna Spencers how to present and get better feedback.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pudcGQoCT6Q) >**FU #6: Treating referrals like free lottery tickets** Its rare for your professional network to refer you more than once and if they do, start counting.

If you were designing a comment system from scratch, what would you do differently? Would you go more toward **Reddit’s threaded, community-driven model**, or **Quora’s structured Q&A style** that keeps focus on the main question?

1ojli18,2025-10-30T00:27:35,UXDesign,What would you do about low level designers that don’t seem interested in growing?,"I joined my current company about a year ago, taking over a team of 10 Designers. Things were kind of a mess when I joined - the team didn’t trust my predecessor and didn’t feel like they got good guidance from that person. I put a lot of work into rebuilding trust and building the support structures the team needed to feel confident in the their roles. I rewrote the career ladder to provide greater clarity and more realistic leveling of skills. I held workshops with them to understand their issues with the review process, the design system, and reporting structures, so that we could all share in the solution and they would see their concerns being addressed. I certainly wouldn’t claim things are perfect, but for the most part, I think things have gotten better for folks. Where I’m still having issues is 2 of the most junior members of the team. They have both been at the Product Designer level since they started, about 4-5 years. They both told me they want to be promoted to Sr Product Designer. After assessing their work and skills in the first half of the year, I didn’t think either was ready, and I gave them very specific feedback on the areas where I felt I needed to see growth. I gave them new project assignments where they could have the opportunity to work with a more senior team member in a growth area, so they would have mentorship and gain experience. They did the work, but didn’t seem to engage with the mentorship. I offered to do extra coaching sessions with them, or approve classes or books if they wanted some independent learning. I didn’t really get any traction here either. It’s not that I expect them to improve overnight, but I do expect them to show some proactive engagement in the things I’m saying will help their careers. I believe the problem is that neither of them is truly interested in growing in this career. I’m frustrated with feeling like my guidance is falling on deaf ears and I’ve run out of ways to get them to engage on this. So the question for you all - is it reasonable for me to expect growth? Or even for growth to be a job expectation? I honestly didn’t realize that I was expecting it before this. If someone reaches Lead Designer and says “yea I’m good here, I’ve mastered my craft” - I can respect that. But for a designer in an entry level position to not be motivated to at least make it to a Senior title… I’m baffled; I’ve never experienced this. It’s making me question whether they really want this job and if not, are they a drag on the team morale? My company has recently redone our performance review process and put a lot more emphasis on performance and growth. I am seriously wondering if I’m going to have to let them go, regardless of where I personally land on the ‘growth as a job expectation’ debate.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1ojli18/what_would_you_do_about_low_level_designers_that/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

Phrases I’ve heard are “there’s no role for that” before landing a product design role by restructure, “Exceeds expectations” is expected and falls under meeting expectations” and “you have to consistently act above your experience level to get promoted” it just seems like a constant moving goal post.

1ojd8xg,2025-10-29T18:57:23,UXDesign,The Evolution of Quality in Human–Computer Interfaces,"The quality of a human–computer interface has never been a fixed notion. It evolved through several stages, each redefining the balance between the system and its user. At the dawn of computing, quality meant how well the user understood the system. The command line demanded obedience to syntax and logic, as if the human had to speak the machine’s private language. With the rise of personal computing, quality became a measure of how well the system explained itself to the user. Icons, tooltips, and windows softened the encounter between human intention and machine precision. In the modern paradigm, quality is defined by how well the system understands the user. Predictive algorithms, adaptive feeds, and conversational assistants shifted the focus from comprehension to recognition. The system now listens, interprets, and sometimes even anticipates. The next stage—already unfolding before our eyes—asks a new question: how well can the user explain themself to the system? The interface of natural language, where a request replaces a command, turns communication into the core of creation. This marks a conceptual rupture. The user no longer needs to understand the machine; it is enough to express intention. Responsibility silently migrates from human to algorithm. Any failure of understanding is now attributed to the system’s lack of intelligence, not to the user’s imprecision. Thus, the interface becomes less a surface and more a mirror. It reflects not our technical literacy but our ability to form meaning. Each new generation of interfaces teaches us less about machines—and a little more about ourselves.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1ojd8xg/the_evolution_of_quality_in_humancomputer/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

They prefer pretty much everything center align, which causes a lot of back and forth, and unnecessary discussions. To me, the centered version feels disconnected and a bit awkward on desktop. I’ve tried explaining hierarchy and flow, but it didn’t really land, so I’d love to hear what others think: • In this kind of setup, would you left-align or center the form? • How do you usually justify your choice to clients who lean on personal preference and insists something is a taste issue? Any examples or arguments that have worked for you would be really helpful. This client is very vulgar, stubborn, and sometimes disrespectful.

But I have some questions for anyone who's used this. \- Can you set up multiple MCP servers within the same Figma environment (your account)? Figma's documentation on this is a little confusing here, while they say you cannot do this, they also mention that you can configure multiple MCP clients (VS code, cursor, claude) to connect to the same local server instance. Which I understand, however, once I connect to one client (eg: Cursor), I cannot find a way to disconnect and connect to another (eg: VS Code). The only option I have here is to disable the MCP server. \- Realistically, the goal with setting this process up would be to reduce the number of feedback loops with devs, and eventually reduce the overall time it takes to complete POCs (especially demos). My question here is, sometimes there are one-off features where we don't necessarily utilise a design system, meaning, there's no need for variables since the goal is ship and validate fast or these projects are just single-use features. In this case, does this workflow still work, or does it necessarily require a design system to be set up, variables, components and everything in order, for it to be effective?

1oi5mwh,2025-10-28T10:23:49,UXDesign,What can a solo designer realistically take up in a startup setup?,"// chatgpt formatted for better coherence Hey everyone, I joined a remote startup a few months ago. It pays well, and I enjoy the work. However, the workload is inconsistent, with some weeks being packed and others quiet. I’m the only designer working remotely, so my work mainly involves refining and expanding the app. Occasionally, I handle branding or visual design tasks. I have about 3 years of design experience. In my previous MNC role, I worked in a collaborative, fast-paced design team with structured UX processes like explorations, design audits, and iterative feedback loops. Even though I wasn’t leading these activities, I was part of them, making the process fun and efficient. At the startup, my role is more responsible, and I make most design decisions alone. However, it can feel isolating. There are long stretches with no feedback on tasks, and then suddenly I’m told something’s off, which is frustrating because I can’t say, “You never reviewed it, so I assumed it was fine.” I also find it challenging when the founders change directions frequently or push decisions that go against design logic. It’s demotivating to keep reworking something I know could’ve been stronger if feedback or collaboration was smoother. So I’m curious — for those who’ve been in a similar setup: ▫️ What can a solo designer realistically take up on their own to stay productive and valuable — beyond just delivering tasks and screens. ▫️How do you deal with long feedback gaps, shifting directions, or creative isolation without burning out? Would really appreciate insights from anyone who’s been through this phase or figured out sustainable ways to handle it.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1oi5mwh/what_can_a_solo_designer_realistically_take_up_in/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

Some industries are obviously more sensitive than others but in almost every case you’re sharing details from an assignment that were intended to give your organization an advantage over competitors. This advantage isn’t necessarily limited to the artifacts that you produced but also details about the internal operations of the company. Things like whether or not the company uses a design system, what kind of tech stack you’re working with, the kind of market research that your company is doing, etc. All of this reveals information about the company you’re working with. My company has HR mandated training that explicitly includes content about how no one is allowed to take any of the materials they worked on with them after their employment concludes. Everyone I talk to is in a similar position when it comes to sourcing content that they worked on for their portfolio. Generally speaking, you have to be careful about how you share it with yourself because, by doing so, you are in violation of your employment. If sourcing content for a portfolio puts so many people at risk of losing their jobs, why do we consider this an ethical practice? Edit: To be clear, I’m not looking for pointers on how to hide my portfolio from my current or previous employer(s). My question is whether or not it is ethical to require that people to steal the intellectual property from an employer in order for them to be considered during the hiring process. Edit: I want to clarify that an NDA violation includes sharing information like performance metrics on an iteration of a feature and disclosure of internal processes like how you gather data or how you gather insights from customers. A number of folks have wanted to get into the specifics about what is covered by an NDA. The answer is… whatever the employer decides is covered by the NDA.

And every time it seems to me that they want *only* a ui Designer or a UX designer or a UX researcher or a Produxt Designer, etc etc. But as I say, I'm able to be all of them, what's the point here? Every time I fall into be nothing to them. And so I'm stuck and for that really sad too : I learned design and I deeply feel to be a designer but no one seems to understand design, and to understand me as a designer...

1ogeeun,2025-10-26T07:26:02,UXDesign,Need advice: How to deal with a new BA who’s from the client side (I’m a Junior UI/UX Designer),"Hey everyone, I could use some advice from experienced designers or anyone who has worked in a client–agency setup. I’ve been working on a project for over a year now. The client is based in the US, and we’re developing a software product for them. I’m a **Junior UI/UX Designer**, responsible for the look, feel, and overall experience of the product. Until now, I collaborated closely with a **Business Analyst (BA)** from *my organization*. He was my main point of contact — he gathered client requirements, created user stories, and shared them with me. I used to design based on those and review my work internally with him before it went to the client. At first, we had a few disagreements — I used to push for user-centered design decisions, while he was more focused on keeping the client happy. Eventually, I stopped pushing too much and just did what aligned with the client’s preferences. Later, I also had to set boundaries around weekend work, but things got smoother over time, and we worked really well together. Now the challenge: That BA has **left the company**, and the new BA joining the project is **from the client’s side**, not ours. This means I’ll now be working directly with someone from the client team, without that “buffer” or translator I used to have internally. I’m not quite sure how to navigate this situation — especially since I can’t reach out to this new BA as freely as I used to with my internal one. I’d love your advice on: * How to build a good working relationship with a client-side counterpart. * How to communicate effectively without overstepping boundaries. * How to balance professionalism and collaboration, especially when there’s no internal intermediary anymore. Any insights or personal experiences would be really helpful. I’m still early in my career and want to handle this transition the right way. Thanks in advance! **TL;DR:** I’ve been working on a client project for a year with an internal BA who handled all client communication. He recently left, and now a new BA from the *client’s side* is taking over. I’m unsure how to work directly with a client-side BA without that internal buffer. Looking for advice on building a good working relationship, communicating effectively, and maintaining professionalism in this new setup.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1ogeeun/need_advice_how_to_deal_with_a_new_ba_whos_from/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

Vibe coding is exploding the amount of UX opportunity is out there right now. There are an insane amount of UX jobs out there…they just don’t exist yet. There are countless startups and small tech companies being created every day that have no idea what UX is or how badly they need it. They are writing code, building features, and wondering why users keep churning. That is your opening. Instead of finding those companies, doing some research, picking up the phone, and selling the value of UX, most people just refresh LinkedIn, click “Easy Apply,” and hope something sticks. When that doesn’t work, they come on this subreddit to complain about the market. If you really believe in the value of UX, go create the opportunity. Find a company that is struggling with usability, message them, call them, book an appointment, and pitch them. Convince them why they need a UX team and why you should be the one to build it. The truth is, most of you aren’t bad designers, or lazy people…you’re just rotten at sales and aren’t being proactive about your job search. The days of being able to go online and just find a UX job are gone. Now you need to get out there and sell UX to these startups that don’t know what it is.

If you could clone the chat from a certain point, you could explore each branch without losing context. Second, there should be a way to link back to specific parts of the same conversation. Let’s say you want to respond to something the model said earlier — maybe 15 or 20 messages back — you should be able to connect directly to that message.

One of the choices on my shortlist was a $1,000 AI powered oven with a built in camera and an app for remote management. The pitch: you put food in, it recognizes what it is, and cooks it to perfection. Wife vetoed that as being excessive. I looked at a bunch of options, with many having really questionable design choices or UIs. (Like a double oven that came with only a single crumb tray, or a single button that needs to be pressed over and over to switch modes) Finally decided on a $100 model from Costco. You turn it on and it defaults to your last setting - with sensible settings for each mode when you switch modes (via individual options on a touch screen). I discovered that 99% of the time I'm just cooking things in Air Fry mode at 400F for 10 minutes - one press to turn it on, one press to start and that's it. It's one of the most straightforward UIs I've seen on a kitchen appliance. Meanwhile, I've seen reports that OTA updates bricked many of the $1k AI toasters.

Now I've been experimenting in Figma where the main content can scroll independently of the sidebar with secondary details. Picture a typical 'register new phone subscription'-page with (main) your new phone and plan and (secondary) the summary. In my case both the main and secondary content can exceed the vertical viewport. While this certainly looks nice, with a user capable of reading all of the secondary details without the main content scroll along and be distracting, I'm worried about aesthetics versus WCAG. Especially on Windows, scrollbars are very ugly. On the other hand is WCAG that defines that scrollbars should always be visible, unless you have other clear cues for scrollable content. I'm not sure how to tackle this specific situation. I can easily revert to have the entire screen be scrollable and be gone with the issue, or improve the visual design (subject to opinion). However, then I have to acknowledge the WCAG part. While I know the exact (small) user base for this specific product contains no users with a handicap, I want to learn how to tackle this issue to demonstrate/teach to colleagues that may run into similar issues and require WCAG.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1oewxmd/how_do_you_handle_aesthetics_vs_wcag_in_regard_to/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

Currently, users can create an account, but many customers — especially tourists who visit us only once — prefer not to register. Therefore, we’re introducing an unregistered checkout flow. The main question we’re facing: how can we best ensure that the email address entered is correct? A simple typo could prevent the customer from receiving their purchased digital product. **I see two possible approaches:** a) Two input fields (“Email address” and “Confirm email address”). I know this may seem old-fashioned, but it’s a reliable method in my opinion. To improve accuracy, copy-pasting between the fields would be disabled. b) A single email input field followed by sending a verification email. This feels more modern, but I’m not a fan of the resulting interruption in the checkout experience. What’s your opinion on this? Thank you!

1oe8cga,2025-10-23T16:44:49,UXDesign,Treated like a visualizer,"Greetings! I am a UX designer working in a consulting agency. We're in the bidding to secure a project for a healthcare client that involves building an application that is powered by AI. I am consistently treated as a visualizer for the PMs and genAI Product manager's ideas. And user experience is placed as am afterthought in their solution response documents. I have to actively ask for my detailed UX approaches to be included. Or else they only focus on tech solutions, capabilities, use cases & features. Boy do they love ""features"".. ""smart XYZ, intelligent ABC, nextgen PQR, advanced something else..."" The senior project manager (in charge of this proposal) and technical project manager are the ones who speak with the user to brainstorm use cases, they send these use cases to the AI product managers who ideate features for those use cases and write ""userflows""- an incomplete, misundertood scenario with a list of screens with descriptions of what they want to see in it. They collect NO feedback from the user to see if they have understood the use case properly and if the solution is actually useful. This list of screens is passed on to me to visualize. I am completely left out of key conversations. I am only briefed after they happen. The end result is a proposal that is entirely focused on technical capabilities, disjointed features, delivery cycles, etc. Our agency is specifically skilled in the healthcare space. But our proposal seems to lack anything thay says ""here are the nuances of your typical users, we understand them, and this is how we can help you"". As designers we are taught in research to find these gold nuggets and use them to collaboratively build an overall strategy for the product.. This is how the team works. Ideally we should all be collaboratively brainstorming. But UX is left out of these discussions. I have actively asked to be part of discussions, but i am just told to visualize and not worry about the brainstorming. The PMs and product managers are extremely well educated from premium institutes and have more work experience than me. I have just about 3 years of experience as a UX designer. So my views are only considered ONLY when i start a discussion with the users and show that the AI team's interpretation of the use case and features are incomplete, and mine are. is it okay for a proposal to be more capability focused instead of being equally focused on capabilities and experience nuances?

Here’s my setup: * I maintain **clickable prototypes** and **user flow diagrams** within the same Figma file. * I also have a **working page** where I create and iterate on screen designs. * There’s another **developer handoff page** where I mark spacing, specs, and other details. * Occasionally, these screens are **copied into other project pages** within the same file for reference or reuse. The issue is, whenever I make changes to a screen, I have to manually replace it everywhere else — which is time-consuming and error-prone. I’m considering requesting access to **Overflow** to help manage the user flows better. However, for **clickable prototypes**, I’d still need to manually update all screen copies if any changes occur.

But here’s the problem, I’ve never actually built a portfolio. It’s becoming clear that not having one has really slowed me down, and it still is. Every time I try to create case studies, I end up feeling lost. I have so much information from my past projects, and I find so much online, that I don’t even know where to start or what to include. I’m also struggling with impostor syndrome for not having a portfolio or a clearly defined “process” like everyone else seems to. Sometimes it feels like the UX space has become a bit performative, where everyone tries to showcase a perfect, step-by-step process as if it’s always linear and structured like building a house from the ground up. That’s not how most real projects work, and it leaves me wondering how much of that messy process I should show. I’m also aiming to move my career to the next level by joining a FAANG or other top-tier company. I want to be seen and visible at that level, but I know I can’t get there without a strong portfolio that reflects my real experience and impact. Should I create shorter, teaser-style case studies or include a bit from every part of the process? Should I focus more on outcomes, impact, or challenges? I’m really struggling to figure out how to structure it all in a way that tells a story instead of feeling like I’m just blogging about my day-to-day work.

So this is the line if have heard couple of time now. And because i happen to own design consultant company in Finland i have to take this seriously. What is happening right now, is that small product teams are moving their live prototypes to Lovable so that everyone can design solutions and create prototypes. They say, that process is much faster because in most cases you can then pull out the frontend code to cursor which basically means designer would be able to ship frontend code. Now, in some cases this kind of process and set of tools does make sense to me. But in many cases i feel like there is still need for someone who can actually polish the details on Figma and there is need for this aswell. I see Cursor, lovable, bolt, v0 etc. as new tools for designers to use. New tools create new kind of processes so therefore i think we are now talking about design operations. I believe: \- These are here to stay \- These do make process faster in many cases \- Every designer will use some of these tools in organization of all sizes, also the the corporate ones What i would like to understand is: \- What kind of product teams would get most value of these new tools and processes \- What do these teams look like? \- What do their processes look like?

But I never saw LLMs used in the Production phase, by this I mean actually creating the UI and so on. I myself use LLMs to prototype faster (creating UIs myself then assembling interactive prototypes made of code instead of static-interactions like any prototyping tools) but outside of this didn't have much use.

Currently you begin the ""appointment"" and in there you can make a sale. The first version only showed some info about the client's balance. After some interviews I made the second one with everything some salesperson told me was important and kept the usual flow. So I only added info and made some look more interesting, not many changes and only one optional guide/assistance added. For the third one I redid the userflow. Since the salesperson will keep coming to this screen after every sale on this appointment I highlighted information about the overall sales, suggestions for itens, kept the client balance info but mostly sent the pertinent details to separate screens to be accessed through the top menu. What do you think? It's one of the most drastic redesigns I made for them so I quite insecure about it and am looking for feedback. Also I censured sensitive data, the rest are fictional.

1oaujv8,2025-10-19T16:49:09,UXDesign,Personalization UX advice needed,"I run a premium personalization e-com gifting brand (add a name, pick colors, etc.). We’re auditing our product + checkout flows and I’d love your UX advice. We are not cheap, so the flow has to feel effortless and premium. Customization adds steps, more clicks, slower choices, more cognitive load. That clashes with UX basics, Even though personalization is growing but is that what people really want? We’re doubting lately how much freedom to offer. We started to simplify the process, for example: we used to show 10+ thread colors but data said customers picked the same five, so we cut to five. It’s faster and cleaner, but next to competitors we “look” like we offer less even if they’re the right five. We’re also considering a radical simplification: keep only the name as input, and we handle the rest (best-looking combo by default). It would turn a 6-step customizer into a single clean step, with the design shown right on the product page. This is a big change and a risk for us, what do you think? We ovs will do A/B but we want to run the right tests. Is it better to tuck options behind a clear Personalization section (expand to edit), or show everything up front and risk overwhelm? What do you think? If you’ve shipped “guided minimalism,” how did you make it still feel *curated* rather than “we removed your choices”?

However I have been asked by others why I don't have such certifications myself. At this point, I am not sure the investment of time/money is worth is besides saying ""I have this certification"".

1oknbaw,2025-10-31T06:30:03,india,WARNING: My 3.5-month nightmare with Sundayrest. They sent me the WRONG SIZE and are now lying to avoid a refund.,"Hey everyone, I’m writing this as a final warning to anyone considering buying a mattress from **Sundayrest** (@sundayrest). I’m currently in a 3.5-month-long battle to get a refund for a mattress *they messed up*, and they’ve just escalated from incompetence to outright fraud. I need to share this so no one else gets scammed. **TL;DR: Sundayrest's rep advised me to buy a mattress, they sent me the WRONG SIZE, and I've been trying to return it since July 12. After 3.5 months of their own excuses (festive season, etc.), they are now fabricating a story that I was ""unavailable"" and have ""closed my request"" without a refund, even though I have proof they're lying.** # The Backstory (Why I'm Even Returning It) This is actually the *second* mattress I got from them. 1. I bought the first one in April, didn't like it, and returned it. 2. Their *own sales representative* guided me, telling me I should go for a specific cheaper, harder model that would be ""good for my back."" 3. I trusted their ""expert"" advice and ordered the one they recommended. 4. **They sent me the WRONG SIZE.** The return request I filed on **July 12** was to fix *their* mistake. This entire 3.5-month nightmare is because they sent me a product I couldn't even use. # The 3.5-Month Nightmare Timeline * **July 12 - Aug 20 (39 DAYS):** I file the return for the wrong-sized mattress. For 39 days, I am fully available. I follow up constantly. The *only* excuses I get are ""logistical delays"" and ""issues with our courier"" (Blue Dart). They fail to make a *single* pickup attempt. I have call logs showing I was blowing up their phone. * **Mid-August:** I have to travel (to Canada) from Aug 20 to Sep 15. Being a responsible customer, I inform them in advance. I even **provide an alternate contact number** for them to coordinate the pickup. * **The ""Promise"":** A Sundayrest representative *confirms* to me that he will update the courier service with this new number. * **Aug 20 - Sep 15:** Absolutely nothing. No calls to my number, no calls to the alternate number. They deliberately ignored me. * **Late Sept / October:** I am back and still trying to get this sorted. I call them numerous times. Their new excuse? **""We are delayed because of the festive season.""** Again, 100% *their* delay. * **October 1:** After I send an angry email, they reply (12 days later!) with a generic apology, **admitting in writing** that there was a ""delay in processing your return request."" # The SCAM (Today, Oct 31) After stringing me along for 3.5 months with *their* excuses (for a mistake *they* made), they've suddenly changed their story. They are now claiming that they *tried* to pick it up *only after I left for Canada*, ""could not access"" me (even though they had the alternate number), and have therefore **CLOSED MY RETURN REQUEST.** This is a calculated, fraudulent move. 1. They intentionally waited until I was out of the country to create a false excuse. 2. They never called the alternate number their own re...",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1oknbaw/warning_my_35month_nightmare_with_sundayrest_they/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
1okn8ya,2025-10-31T06:25:36,india,Please think twice before joining this NGO in Bengaluru,"I used to work at an NGO in Bangalore called ""Gubbachi Learning Community"", which works for the welfare of the migrant population. I’m writing this to warn future employees to think twice before signing your contract if you're ever offered a position at this place. When I joined, I was excited about the work they do and believed in their mission. But very soon, the work environment became unbearable with micromanagement, last-minute meetings scheduled on the same day, late night messages and calls, and being expected by my superior to show up at an expensive café in Koramangala for “informal meetings” that I couldn’t afford with my NGO salary. My superior, who is one of the founders, increasingly treated me more like a personal assistant than a professional hired for my expedtise. When I brought these issues up with HR and management, I was initially told they wanted to “work through the issues.” Two days later, the same HR person called and pressured me to resign. When I refused, I was fired without any due process. The gave no warnings, no inquiry, nothing. Keep in mind that my 3-month review had no negative comments and none of my coworkers had issues with my conduct. After I sent a legal notice through a lawyer, they denied everything and even threatened me with a criminal case over a GoPro camera that was still in my possession. They had been ignoring my calls since the day of termination so there was no way for me to coordinate but I just decided to send it through rapido. My case is now pending with the Labour Commission. However, it has been almost 4 months since the termination and it has taken a toll on my mental health. They've refused to give me my relieving letter, experience certificate, or payslips, effectively freezing my career. I’ve had to rely on my partner and parents just to survive these months. I'm fighting for my case through the labour commission because I don't want them to continue their unethical practices. This seems to be their pattern rather than just my experience, as other past employees have also shared their issues with me and I also had to clean up their reviews on employment portals and google as part of my job.

I recently saw an old homeless lady on allwyn x road. The last time I saw her, she looked very weak — she has lost a lot of weight, and flies were sitting on her body. A few kind people occasionally give her food, but she clearly needs proper shelter, medical care, and regular meals. It’s raining these days, and I’m really worried about where she’ll sleep or stay in this condition. I already tried contacting two NGOs, but I haven’t received any response so far. I read that the government provides free shelters for homeless people, and there’s one in Uppal. For now, I can help her with some money, but I don’t speak Telugu, so I’m unable to communicate with her properly to understand her story or if she’s willing to go to a shelter. Unfortunately, my friends are hesitant to help as they think it’s risky. I’m stuck and don’t know how to proceed. If anyone knows any active NGO, volunteers, or government helpline who can help rescue her and take her to a government hospital or shelter, please let me know.

1ok9frc,2025-10-30T19:37:08,india,"My friends paid ₹10,000 for Aakash Invictus Test Series but some can’t access any tests — what should they do?","A few of my friends enrolled in Aakash Institute’s Invictus Test Series, which costs around ₹10,000. It’s supposed to be a premium test package for aspirants — offering multiple full-length tests, flexible attempt timings, and exclusive video solutions meant only for Invictus students. But some students are facing major issues: • Some can’t access any tests at all — their test portals show nothing. • Others can access all tests fully — so it’s inconsistent. • The video solutions (said to be exclusive) are now publicly available on YouTube, which defeats the purpose. They’ve tried everything they could think of — emailing support, contacting the branch, branch manager, academic head, and even the Head Office — but nothing worked. Even the academic head said he isn’t getting any point of contact to escalate the issue. It feels really unfair because the students who can’t access the tests have basically lost ₹10,000 for nothing. They’re considering posting publicly (like on Twitter/X tagging Aakash) to get attention from higher-ups. Before doing that, I wanted to ask here — is that the right step? Or should they go through some official route like a consumer complaint? Would really appreciate any advice or if anyone faced something similar 🙏 (I framed this post with the help of ChatGPT since it’s my first time posting on Reddit and I wanted to explain the issue clearly.) TL;DR: Some Aakash Invictus students can’t access any tests even after paying ₹10k, videos are public, and there’s been no help from Aakash so far.

She believes I didn’t fight enough, that I should’ve stood up for us. Maybe she’s right from her side. But it was useless to fight a war that was already lost. I know my parents they won’t change. And what can you even say when love isn’t enough to beat circumstances? She never stopped supporting me, no matter what. Never made me feel alone. And honestly, I’ve never seen a girl as beautiful as her inside and out. Every time I think about it, I get angry at myself. Angry because I lost someone who truly stood by me. No fight, no cheating, no drama — just reality breaking everything we built. 6 years, and it all ended not because we stopped loving, but because life decided otherwise. Today I met her after the breakup, just to collect a few things I’d left at her place. I couldn’t even look her in the eyes. I don’t know if it was fear, guilt, or shame — maybe all of it. Seeing her again felt like facing everything I couldn’t fix. Now it’s strange to come home to nothing. Messages stopped, routines vanished. It’s that kind of love that fails, not because of mistakes but because it was never allowed to win.",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ok5ndf/6_years_together_ended_because_my_family_will/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

Unfortunately, due to constant mental harassment and discrimination—since my father is a stepson while my uncles are the biological sons of my step-grandmother—my family went through a lot. My step-grandmother even manipulated my grandfather against us. Recently, a serious argument broke out within the family, during which one of my step-uncles even physically assaulted my mother by grabbing her neck.We had it enough , and we decided to move out of the house. We are now renting an apartment, but my family is facing financial difficulties. My father is the sole earner—he runs a small medical shop that currently generates only around ₹10,000 per month, which is not enough to cover our living expenses, especially with my college education in a Tier-1 city adding to the costs. My mother, who has completed her 12th grade, is now looking for a job to support our family. We are seeking work-from-home opportunities such as call centre, customer support, or any suitable roles. If there are any available openings or if you know someone who could offer such opportunities, I would be extremely grateful for your help. If a work-from-home job is not possible, we live near nashik so onsite job anywhere near is possible. Additionally, if there are any exams that she could appear based on her qualification like clerk etc, please guide us on that as well.

I waited there for more than 30 minutes, asking around the neighborhood, but no one knew the customer. It was already around 11 PM, so I finally marked the order as “delivered” and left. I was super angry the food (chicken curry and ghee rice) was from a well-known restaurant, and I didn’t want it to go to waste. Since I’m vegetarian, I couldn’t eat it myself. On my way back home, I saw a couple of transgenders near the highway. I’d never spoken to any before, but I stopped and asked if they’d had dinner. They were surprised at first, then said no.

1ojyn56,2025-10-30T12:42:45,india,I'm emotionally dependent on the friend who was there during my suicide attempt. He knows it. He uses it. How do I break free?,"I don't even know where to start with this mess. So I have this friend who's been in my life for years. He's 26, I'm 21. We used to be close, but now being around him makes me miserable. Like genuinely miserable. We went to Rishikesh recently - this beautiful place that should've been amazing - and the entire time I was just angry, irritated, and unhappy because of him. He's controlling as hell, always trying to dominate every situation like he owns me or something. Here's where it gets complicated. When I attempted suicide, he was the one who showed up at the hospital. Before that, I'd introduced him to my dad because his business was struggling, and my dad helped him out with connections and advice. Later, his connections helped me get into a new college. So there's this voice in my head that keeps saying I owe him everything. But this dude is exhausting. He constantly complains about how work sucks, money problems, and then turns it around on me saying how easy I have it, how if he had my family support he'd be in such a better position. He mocks my psychiatrist regularly and tells me I don't need medication, that willpower is enough to fix everything. Then there's the really fucked up stuff I can barely even type out. When I was seeing this girl, he told me to bring her to his office. We were fooling around (everything but sex), and he literally told me he'd never speak to me again if I didn't go all the way. Then he told me to put my hand over her mouth and just do it. I gave in to the pressure. She cried. I stopped immediately, apologized, tried to comfort her, but I felt absolutely disgusted with myself. After that, he said he wanted to sleep with her because he ""wanted young eighteen year old pussy."" Recently I started dating someone new, and he called her a buffalo to my face. Told me not to have sex with her, said I'm not ready for all this. Meanwhile he's constantly on my case about my occasional weed use (which I've discussed with my doctor), but he chain-smokes and drinks all the time. He's learned this manipulation technique where he gives me the silent treatment and refuses to actually address problems when I try to talk. But then at night he'll suddenly love bomb me with ""tu mera bhai hai"" and all this emotional stuff. More examples: I bought tickets to an anime movie with my own money, took him along. I was having fun with some other guys in the theater, and he just stood up, told me to my face it's a shitty movie, and walked out. Another time I said I wasn't feeling well and couldn't go to a movie, and he got furious and blocked me. Our last big fight was because he's gotten super religious and dogmatic. I ate an egg roll and it made him furious. I threw it away after one bite - literally threw it on the road - and he still wouldn't talk to me. I had to call and apologize. He suggested the Rishikesh trip as a peace offering. But here's what keeps me stuck: he was there when I failed my most important exam. He came to the hospita...",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ojyn56/im_emotionally_dependent_on_the_friend_who_was/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1ojt6m2,2025-10-30T07:21:21,india,"Looking for support, volunteers, collaborators for our small NGO","I’m part of a small NGO in Madhya Pradesh, which we started back in 2020 during the Covid lockdowns. The initial idea was simply to reach out to children who were deprived of quality education and couldn’t go to school due to the pandemic. While teaching them, we noticed their enthusiasm. They start running towayis as soon as they see us coming to take evening classes. On one teacher's day, they got together without any knowledge of ours, made flower bouquet, decorated the class with balloons and bought a cake for us. Keep in mind that they are poor living with very limited resources. It must have cost them atleast Rs. 300-500 and we all were in tears seeing this. Their curiosity and energy pushed us to continue even after the lockdowns ended, and over time, our work naturally grew into three areas: 1. Community-based education for children outside the school system. 2. Theatre and storytelling to help them express and build confidence. 3. Science experiments to make learning fun and hands-on. The only resources we had were ourselves and what we have learnt. We’ve been working tirelessly with limited means, and eventually realised that while we can impact deeply, our reach is limited. So, we got registered as a society to build a more efficient structure and invite more people to join in. Now, we’re looking for people who’d like to support or collaborate with us in any way possible. Here’s what we could really use help with right now: 👩‍🏫 Volunteers or mentors for teaching, theatre, or creative learning 📢 Social media & outreach support — to spread awareness about our work 💻 Website development or guidance — we already own a domain but couldn't build the site yet 🎒 Donations or resource support — educational materials, art supplies, science kits, or even small financial contributions to sustain our sessions 💡 General guidance or collaboration — anyone experienced in NGO management, fundraising, or community work I can provide our Instagram page link where you can check out our ongoing activities.

1ojneba,2025-10-30T01:55:26,india,"Is being born with dark skin a curse? Does it cause problems in marriage, jobs, schools, colleges, or other places? Am I just my skin, or something more? What actually self realization is?","My Realization: If Zebra wants to be Horse, then there is no Zebra. This is the harsh reality of our world, but no one talks about it. Society judges people based on their skin color. You might think this is nonsense and that we live in a modern world where skin color doesn’t matter. But wait…!!!! I have something to share. As a person with dark skin, I’ve faced many challenges because of my skin tone. In many societies, dark skin is linked to being poor, uneducated, unhygienic, or low-class. When I was a kid, I was once slapped and pushed out of a community event. A man thought I was a snatcher waiting to steal something, but I was just following my mother in the crowd. This was just one small incident. As I grew up, I faced more: No one wanted to be with someone with dark skin(except friends). I was ignored in shops, malls, and restaurants. Dark-skinned people are rarely chosen as leading face for photos in schools, workplaces, or other institutions like coaching centers. Forget about Bollywood or the fashion industry. In marriage, dark-skinned people are low on the priority list unless they have money, a degree from IIT or IIM, or come from a rich family. This colorism started during colonial times when our ancestors were humiliated for their dark skin. Even today, many societies carry this mindset, or you can say memory of bad experiences. We worship Lord Ram, Lord Krishna, and Maa Kali, but society still prefers white skin because Britishers were white. Look at actors, actresses,the fashion industry, and the advertisements, they all promote fair skin. British colonialism ended long ago, so why does colorism still exist? The fashion and movie industries constantly push fair skin to make us feel insecure and doubtful about ourselves. Why? Because they want to sell products like Fair & Lovely, sunscreens, and glow-up treatments. If we feel good about ourselves, we won’t buy their products. This creates a vicious cycle. We stay insecure and pass our bad experiences and trauma to others, making colorism worse. I didn’t listen to my parents when they told me to ignore colorism and focus on myself. I thought they didn’t understand my pain or were just trying to save money. I secretly spent a lot of money on creams, face washes, and treatments, but nothing changed. I still had dark skin. All the hate, colorism, and self-doubt wasted my time and money. I could have used that time to grow and live a better life. Instead of accepting myself and working on who I am, I tried to prove myself to others. I passed my bad experiences(frustration) to others because it felt satisfying. The world wants to control us and keep us away from our true selves. Our identity is not our skin color, that’s what I should have learned earlier. Instead of worrying about my skin and the bad things that happened, I should have accepted the world, stopped this cycle of negativity, and worked on my true self. I just needed to accept myself the way I am.

1ojfdso,2025-10-29T20:18:01,india,Ramayana | What exactly was the suspicion on Sita for which had to give Agni pariksha?,"The agni pariksha incident in Yuddha Kanda is puzzling for me despite reading so many perspectives on it. I am missing some obvious point here so I want to understand it. One thing is clear, the harsh words spoken by Ram to Sita about her chastity and rejecting her were a pretence. Its very clearly explained in Valmiki Ramayana that Ram never doubted her and he said what he said in order to prove the society about Sita's ""purity"". But I want to understand the concept of purity and chastity here. Shri ram says (6.118.16 - 6.118.17) - >Sita! This effort in carrying out with the assistance of valiant friends is not done for your sake. Let it be known to you. I have done this to protect good conduct and my illustrious race from scandal and rid of obloquy from all sides. In the event of doubtful conduct also you are standing firmly like a glowing lamp for me suffering from sore eyes and disagreeable to me. So here, through the phrase ""doubtful conduct"" its implied that Sita might have cheated on Ram to Ravana. She might have given into Ravana's pursuits. But then he says (6.118.24) - >Sita! You are endowed with beauty and having you in his own house for so long and seeing you, how Ravana could have resisted or detained you. Here its implied that Ravana had forced himself on her (Correct?) So what is the doubt about Sita's character here? The fact that Ravana might have forced himself on her?

Old post links are in comments, incase you want to know the full story. A lot has happened since then, and it’s honestly been exhausting but eye-opening. I actually got hold of the CBS audit logs from SBI’s data centre in Belapur. The logs clearly show my data being fetched and printed from SBI branches 31045, 31822, and 11177. With that, I filed multiple RTIs to confirm what exactly happened. The replies were laughable — Lucknow Zone: “No data was breached.” Jaipur Zone: “This RTI is hypothetical in nature.” Like… what? I literally have the logs from your own system. So I filed first appeals — Lucknow’s FAA admitted that my data was fetched, but then said it wasn’t breached (don’t even know how that logic works), and Jaipur’s FAA copy-pasted the same vague reply. I went ahead and filed second appeals, which are still pending before the CIC. Meanwhile, my RBI Ombudsman complaint was in limbo all this while, until last week. RBI finally emailed me, attaching SBI’s official response where they again claimed, “no data breach occurred.” I immediately sent back all my proof — the CBS logs, RTI trail, and emails. A few days later, I got an email from the SBI General Manager (Lucknow) admitting that yes, the data was fetched, but it was “on the request of another customer to check a transaction” and “not printed or shared.” That was the moment I knew they were just shifting narratives. The logs literally say “PRINT,” with the exact branch code and operator ID. And since then, the floodgates have opened — calls and emails from AGMs, GMs, Chief Managers, and Branch Managers, all politely (some desperately) asking me to withdraw the complaint. To be honest, I might’ve considered closing it earlier, but after 6 months of denials, cover-ups, and fake replies, I’m not in the mood to let it slide. It’s not even about money anymore, it’s about accountability. They’ve been caught lying at multiple levels, and only now that I have written proof from their own systems, they’re panicking. At this point, I’m deciding whether to: 1. Let the Ombudsman and CIC process play out — which could officially confirm the breach and possibly get compensation through RBI, or 2. Negotiate a settlement directly, since clearly they want this buried and off record. I can milk them more here. I’m documenting everything — every email, every call, every piece of evidence — because this is way bigger than just one person’s data. If SBI can’t even control internal access to customer data or admit when it’s breached, that’s a serious red flag for everyone banking there. I posted on X. I hope you guys join. Tbh I can just settle and enjoy free money. I am fighting for a change. I hope you guys help. Tag SBI, RBI and other responsible bodied.

There is a lot of favourism and the exam in the end is also not genuine. Every year they fail people to get money out of it. We were told from the begging that at least 2-3 pgs will fail from our batch. I suffered major ragging issues from first year but the hod Even encouraged that person specifically multiple times and mentioned the name to be like that. There will be no particular units to work on, and the time table is a complete mess made to extract all energy from jr1. We never had units and there was no block division of patients. Other unit heads only tries to keep 1-2 patients in the ward and tries to send of every pt by giving negative counselling.

I’m currently working in a remote-based company, earning around 8.3 LPA. I learned everything about AI and tech here — this company really helped me grow. I honestly love it here: my team is great, my managers are kind, and I have close friends here (one of them is like family to me). The problem is — I’ve always felt underpaid compared to others in similar roles. Recently, two of my friends referred me to their companies. I attended the interviews just for the experience, but surprisingly, I got selected in both with \~15 LPA offers. Now I’m in a dilemma. I don’t really want to leave because: I love my current company and team My close friend and social circle are here My parents are nearby, and I’m comfortable with my routine But at the same time, the salary difference is huge, and I can’t ignore that forever. For those who’ve been through something like this — what would you suggest? Should I stay where I’m happy and feel valued emotionally, or move for better pay and career growth?

On the HDFC website, it clearly mentions: > “Minors above the age of 10 years are eligible to open a self-operated minor account and an ATM/Debit card can be issued to the minor.” But when I emailed HDFC customer care, this is the reply I got: > “You can open a Minor's Account as the child is below 18 years of age, and the parent ideally should have a Savings Account with HDFC Bank. Please refer to the below links for Kids accounts: Super Kids Savings Account Kids Advantage Account Note: 1. Minors above 10 years are eligible to open a self-operated minor account. 2. Self-operated accounts cannot be opened in the “Super Kids Savings account.” 3. The minor will be the first account holder, and the parent/guardian will be joint holder. 4. Age proof (birth certificate), PAN, address proof, and photographs are required.” Now I’m a bit confused — the website says minors above 10 can open a regular savings account, but the support team is only suggesting Kids or Kids Advantage accounts, which are parent-linked.

1ohscil,2025-10-27T22:17:07,india,Potential child molester in the NGO I joined as an intern.,"I am currently pursuing my B.Tech degree, and it was mandatory to do a social internship after the second semester. So, I decided to join an NGO near my home, which was basically a school for kids from classes 1 to 12. There were three schools in total, and our group of college students was assigned to teach the students there. It was a fun experience, and it felt nice engaging with the kids. There was also a special student in that school who was under the care of a teacher, let's call him Mr. N. He was very strict with that special child, and it made us feel bad when he used to hit the boy. After our internship ended, this teacher, Mr. N, texted one of my male friends asking him to send “something.” When my friend asked what he meant, Mr. N replied, “Something romantic jismein sab kuch khula khula ho.” My friend showed us those texts, and we were baffled. He asked Mr. N if he was gay (he’s not even married, maybe still in the closet), to which Mr. N said he didn’t understand what he was talking about. After that, my friend blocked him. A few days later, another friend who had also interned with us said that he had received similar types of messages from Mr. N, asking him to send something. Our group discussed it and realized that he might be doing something wrong with the kids too, but we couldn’t prove it. It might be a wrong allegation to put on Mr. N, but my friends said that he might be mistreating the special child in the school, which could explain why the boy seemed so scared of him. I want to know — can a person with such behavior be allowed to teach in a school for children?

He has not supported me well in terms of diet, education and refused to even pay for my medical bills growing up.

My sister's life is ruined too I'm worried it'll make the news, and he or his family would get to know and would try to subject me to more abuse or try to prove I'm mentally ill and try to take the money if not cause issues like threathen to divorce my mom if I leave the house and stuff, my youngest 2 siblings are also autistic. His family lives downstairs and even if I call then police they might show up and try to hard us.. I'd like to keep everything hush hush so he has no idea and to invest in a property or apartment so I have something to my name. Me and my family have no assets cause of him and he's taken my mom's 10 lakhs worth of gold and over 10 lakhs from me from my jobs earnings.. If we try to get married he gets us proposals which don't suit us or purposely cusses the people off so that we don't get married. He made us watch piku, where amitabh in the movie says I did everything for you why would you go anyone elses house and take care of them..he's a narc and isn't treating us well. My grandmother accused me of not being sick and is very old and controlling..she's ruined my life in a number of ways..I've been working since I was 16 and have nothing to my name.. He doesn't let us go to weddings or attend any religious gatherings either..I'm very scared..of him and his abuse He had to get a leg surgery recently and is abroad and seems mellow but ik given the situation he will abuse us verbally, physically or threathen to harm my family or leave my mom..he lives abroad but refused to give me my money back and bread crumbs me to the point that I can only buy protein rich foods for myself like eggs and milk and doesn't send enough..I can't believe my own father is not giving me enough to the point in healthy again..I am in shock over all of this.. I cannot take up responsibility of anyone when it comes to it.. Given this situation my life is in shambles..I'm incredibly sick and depressed to the point that if I let things get to me..I feel like I might die Instead of being happy to get money I'...",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1oheteu/financial_security_from_family/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1oh3pgv,2025-10-27T03:01:56,india,“I don’t hate dogs — but my right to sleep and move freely is gone because of irresponsible ‘dog lovers’ next door.”,"Before anyone judges me — no, I don’t hate dogs and I’ve never harmed one. But I honestly don’t know whose rights come first anymore — the dogs’ or the humans’ fundamental rights to sleep peacefully and move freely in their own street. I’m writing this at 6 a.m. out of sheer frustration. We live in a decent neighbourhood — or at least it used to be. There are a few empty plots everyone uses for parking and kids playing. My father’s best friend lives next door with his unemployed son, daughter, and wife. They have plenty of free time, act like the biggest dog lovers, but are rude to elders and talk behind everyone’s back. About 3–4 years ago, some stray dogs started hanging around. This family began feeding them, and now the dogs treat the whole street like their personal territory. The couple claims they “keep the dogs outside at night for safety,” but in reality, they chain or lock them in empty plots or keep them indoors. The dogs cry through the night, and around 5:30 a.m. they release them — right when milkmen, maids, and walkers come out. Several people have been chased or bitten, yet they always say “they don’t bite” or “they just didn’t recognize you.” From their balcony, they’ll shout “Kallu, stop!” while the dog runs after someone — as if that magically helps. When neighbours held a small meeting, most people spoke sweetly like “We’re not against dogs, but this is getting out of hand,” but behind their backs everyone agreed it’s completely wrong. Only my parents and one elderly lady spoke openly. That lady was rudely told by the dog lover’s wife, “Aapne apne bachon ko sanskaar nahi diye — you’re speaking against dogs!” Since when is asking for safety a sign of bad upbringing? Here’s the irony: the same uncle who calls himself an animal lover beats cows and buffaloes with a stick if they enter the lane, but worships dogs like gods. Their “dog love” is more like a showcase — I’ll keep them when I want, release them when I want, but if they bite or chase someone, it’s not my fault because they’re ‘awaara’. They’ve even started telling street vendors, kabadiwalas, and beggars not to enter the street, saying “if anything happens, not our problem.” What about their right to work and move freely? They literally laugh when dogs chase people. We had to soundproof our room because of constant barking. These dogs aren’t trained — just territorial and aggressive because of how they’re treated. I’ve seen other stray dogs in nearby streets who are calm and non-violent because they aren’t made to feel like they “own” the place. Now every guest who visits has to inform us first, and we walk them out to the main road to make sure the dogs don’t run after them. It’s honestly dadagiri — their love, our loss. It’s always the same story: our love, our freedom — your responsibility. They claim to be dog lovers but take no responsibility when someone is bitten, scared, or can’t sleep at night. I respect genuine dog lovers who care responsibly. But this is pure...",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1oh3pgv/i_dont_hate_dogs_but_my_right_to_sleep_and_move/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00

1oh31w7,2025-10-27T02:29:08,india,The post office people without our consent added agent in our TD account. We Don't even know who is the agent. How to confront him ?is this a scam?,"So my parents had joint account in post office under which they had TD and MIS. So now my mother and I made a joint account and after maturity of those books we r again depositing them for 5 yrs So I'm strictly against post office agents. I live in ABC and in our local post office or surroundings their are many frauds. I can do all the form fillup and necessary things so I don't need one. Last month one of the TD matured and due to my exams I was unable to go to post office but I filled all the forms and even wrote the cheque. My mother went to the post office to submit and the guy who was in the front desk told my mom that I filled tge form wrong and the signature r wrongly done which is an absolute nonsense. Coz I hv done the same for the previous ones and I know I did right. And he said that a guy is sitting who will do everything correctly and don't even charge a penny. He will help her. My mom said if their is any problem in the form fillup give me a fresh a one.He refused. My mom even asked where r the mistakes.He just said ""MANY"". Then after a talk my mom rejected having an agent but he insisted that that guy is not a agent blahh blahh .... and said come later to get the new book. When I saw the new TD Book their is a agent id. And we Don't even know who is the agent. I filled the form did everything why this so called agent will get a benefit I'm not being selfish but I don't want to share my info and financial deposits with anyone.I have heard many cases where the agent scams the shit out of people....now I'm afraid can he close our TD without us knowing. Will h receives commission for our TD and MIS acc also? Will my interest get divided? The other books that I redeposit without a agent will I myself get the commission?",0,,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1oh31w7/the_post_office_people_without_our_consent_added/,2025-10-31T07:11:50.376979+00:00
